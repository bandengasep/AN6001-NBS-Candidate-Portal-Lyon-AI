There were also networking sessions that provided avenues for me to connect with alumni and industry experts.\nKimberly Liew Bei Xin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nAs a sponsored participant with my career locked in for the next few years, I was initially sceptical about how the Career Office could add value to my learning journey with NBS. However, my scepticism was debunked during orientation, when I understood how the Career Office partnered each participant through a structured career journey during our time with NBS and beyond.\nFrom resume building and profiling activities to customised workshops in topics ranging from personal branding to sharing developments within specific industries and sectors, I saw how the Career Office worked to cater to the diverse needs and interests of every participant.\nI took part in some of these workshops and picked up skills which I believe would remain relevant to me throughout my career. What I have also found beneficial was the one-to-one career coaching sessions, from which I not only gained clarity over my career purpose, but also gleaned valuable insights about areas to work on for my personal growth.\nAnthony Chor Xingyou\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nThe Career Office works with participants one-on-one to provide tailored career services through skill workshops, networking sessions, career coaching, and many more. The team also provides many exclusive resources for both full-time and part-time job opportunities.\nI personally found my internship through the Career Office’s network and support, including resume workshops, company visits, and personal coaching sessions. With the strong support, I can rest assured that the Nanyang MBA program will help me elevate my career to the next level.\nChris Lin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nI first learnt about the Career Office during orientation. Since then, I have interacted closely with the team in the office and gained guidance in fine-tuning my resume and understanding potential roles for me to explore.\nThe office also organised networking events and seminars which were helpful in getting me career ready. My favourite has been the personal branding workshop, which helped me better communicate and present who I am.\nA key highlight was also the personal career coach who worked with me to leverage my transferable skills and move into my ideal roles. The Career Office is indeed one’s best friend during this NBS journey, helping set NBS apart from other global MBA programmes.\nLorybeth Rugay Baldrias-Serrano\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nI deeply appreciate the support of the NBS Career Office in guiding me along the job search process.  My career counsellor helped alleviate the apprehension I felt about job interviews. Feedback during mock interviews and from video sessions helped me gain a lot of self-awareness, and I am now more confident of myself during interviews.\nThe Career Office has also been fabulous in tapping into the rich pool of alumni, which NBS has. Through alumni engagement sessions, I had the chance to hear the experience of those now working in companies such as Microsoft, Twitter, Goggle, and P&G. The experience and perspectives shared by these alumni have given me a clearer understanding of my career prospects, and I am deeply grateful to the Career Office for this.\nZhu Siyi\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nReturning to school for a postgraduate degree was a big decision, so I was hoping that the choice of NBS would make sense from both the academic and career angles. I have to say that the Career Office did not disappoint. The activities planned by the Office were well thought through and synced with the recruitment cycles of hiring companies.\nI have benefitted immensely from the help of my career counsellor who gave me career guidance and helped review my resume. The career counsellor simplified the world of internship for me and linked me to available internship opportunities. Knowing that the Career Office is ever ready to support me in my journey is a fantastic feeling and a big assurance to my life in NBS!\nZhang Yuejiao\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2021\nThe decision to leave a full-time job to pursue further studies during a global pandemic was certainly a major decision in my life. My choice of university was very much influenced by what its career office could offer, as I had positive experience with my career office during my undergraduate days in India. I was convinced that NTU was the right choice for me when I attended a programme briefing and the NBS Career Office gave useful information on the support level offered to participants of the programme.\nHaving embarked on the programme with NBS, I must say that the Career Office was everything I expected it to be, and more. The career counsellors in the Office were helpful and encouraging, and organised numerous talks to help participants understand our career options within different functions. Networking sessions with alumni and corporate partners widened our network for job opportunities.\nThe Career Office was also constantly sourcing for internships, and it was through one of these that I got my role with Johnson Controls Innovation Center. The support and guidance from the team has also helped me sharpen my career goals too. I am sure the invaluable support from the Office will continue into the future.\nVivek Goyal\nMSc Business Analytics Class of 2021\nComing from a university in the UK, I had assumed that career offices across all universities would offer similar services. I can now say with confidence that not all offices are the same – the proactive stance of the NBS Career Office sets it apart from the rest.\nApart from \"standard\" services like resume reviews and provision of a jobs portal, the approachable team in the NBS Career Office works to improve employability of every participant. From the start of my term, I worked with my career counsellor on a career development plan.\nWhat I also liked was the open-door policy of the Career Office, wherein I was able to approach any of the counsellors within the team to get insights into various sectors of interest.\nThe office also worked with other experts to equip participants with critical skills – my favourite was one where I learnt how to tell a better story about myself!\nOverall, the Careers team has impressed me with their future-oriented mindset and genuine passion in helping participants. I would recommend any participant interested in improving his or her employability to have a chat with their career counsellor soon!\nDaniel Rivera\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nI did my research prior to taking up my MBA programme. Institutional reputation, extent of alumni network and support of the career office were important considerations for me. For these reasons, I chose the Nanyang MBA. I am glad I did – to this day, I still ask the Career Office for advice on career because I trust them!\nWhen I started the Nanyang MBA, I did not know anyone in Singapore and had no idea how to go about searching for jobs in this country. Raised in Korea and having only worked in Europe, I benefitted immensely from the guidance given by the Career Office in a variety of areas, such as how to introduce myself over LinkedIn, how to get the most out of networking sessions, and how to pitch myself to prospective employers.\nThe Career Office also gave me the opportunity to meet with alumni and their stories of overcoming challenges, similar to what I faced, were very reassuring for me. My confidence in the Career Office was further strengthened when company recruiters attested to the level of effort put in by the Career Office in helping every participant get noticed by hiring managers. The team indeed showed true passion and they are the biggest asset from my NBS days!\nElla Choi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2018\nAPAC IT Data Project Manager, L’Oréal\nThe support provided by the Career Office was immensely helpful throughout my NBS journey. The Career Office lined up a series of workshops to get our resumes ready and equip us with essential interview skills even before we stepped into our first class. Throughout the semesters, the Career Office would also invite guest speakers from various companies to share experiences and provide valuable insights to help us make better and more informed career choices.\nWhat really helped was how the Career Office kept an eye out for opportunities for every participant, whether in the form of internships or full-time roles. This personalised approach was what helped me land my current role.\nThe Career Office was a key supporter through my journey with NBS, and I am glad that I made full use of the open-door policy of the team to get career coaching and counselling. These sessions were definitely more useful than I had initially thought!\nNigel Ng\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2020\nAnalyst, RV Capital\nMy Nanyang Professional MBA journey was truly enriching and fruitful. I received tremendous support in one-to-one coaching and in accessing career opportunities.  I also attended networking sessions and was notified of different job openings and recruitment sessions by renowned companies in various sectors.\nThanks to the Career Office, I successfully secured an interesting job, working directly with high-level stakeholders from around the region. It was through the Career Office that I got the opportunity to interview for this new role, in an industry which I had no prior professional experience in.\nIt was indeed a rare opportunity made possible by the Nanyang Professional MBA and the Career Office, for which I am extremely grateful.\nCheryl Chong\nNanyang Professional MBA Class of 2020\nBusiness Analyst, South Asia Country Group Management & Asia Sales and Client Management, Willis Towers Watson\nGraduating during the COVID-19 pandemic was unnerving, but the support of the Career Office made all the difference.\nFrom the start of the programme, I was given the opportunity to network with alumni and gained valuable insights into different industries and interview processes of several companies.  I also had a career coach who helped me uncover my true passion and worked with me to brand myself around who I truly am.\nWorking with the Career Office as a partner certainly helped me get the most out of my Nanyang MBA with NBS.\nLam Hao Zhi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2020\nManagement Associate, Dole Food Company\nDeloitte’s partnership with the Nanyang Business School (NBS) is a longstanding one.

We look forward to a continued relationship with NBS and help their graduates make an impact that matters in their roles at Deloitte.\nSeah Gek Choo\nDeloitte Singapore\nNTU and NBS have always been one of the most important university partners for JD.com in Singapore.

We look forward to deepening our collaboration with NTU and NBS, and always welcome future NTU talent to the JD.com family.\nHan Huixian\nCampus Recruitment Manager, JD.com\nThe team in the Career Office has been highly proactive in maintaining connections with me.  I have been offered various opportunities to interact with and contribute back to the business school.

      "title": "FAQs",
      "content": "General Programme Questions\nThe MSc Financial Engineering programme at Nanyang Business School is offered under the auspices of a business school with the combined expertise the Nanyang Business School (NBS) and the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS) in NTU. As a result, NTU MFE students learn about financial engineering within the context of business and economic principles, benefit from the expertise of faculty from the Business school as well as SPMS, and enjoy the additional advantages of the business school's career services, corporate contacts, and orientation towards business applications.\nThe MSc Financial Engineering programme also includes an optional seven-week term at Carnegie Mellon University, USA, bringing financial practices in the east and west live to the classrooms. Upon successful completion of the 7-week term, students will be awarded a Certificate in Computational Finance from CMU.\nMBA:  There are many differences between an MFE and MBA. Some of them are obvious, for example the MFE programme can be completed in one year (full-time study), while an MBA typically takes two years. The MFE is a graduate degree in a highly specialized type of Finance, and an MBA is a more general, well-rounded business degree, offering courses in areas such as Marketing, HR/Management, Strategy, Accounting, and Finance.\nMost MBA programmes do not require the high-level of math, analytic ability, or computer programming experience required by the MFE programme. The combination of skills obtained by MFE graduates (understanding of complex financial strategies, financial modelling ability and computational proficiency) are difficult for employers to find in graduates of general MBA or Engineering programmes.\nOther MSc Finance related programmes such as Applied Finance, Wealth Management etc.: Like the MBA programme, these programmes do not offer the combination of skills obtained by MFE graduates. These programmes have less emphasis on math and programming skills and do not offer a combination of finance, mathematics and computing.\nCFA (Chartered Financial Analyst): The main difference is that a CFA is an independent certification process, not an academic distinction. Also, unlike the MFE programme, the CFA has little emphasis on math and programming skills to solve financial problems. Many people in the Finance Industry get their CFA in addition to advanced degrees in Finance. For some jobs it is desirable to have both, but they are not interchangeable by definition.\nAdmissions\nThe MSc Financial Engineering programme at Nanyang Business School looks for candidates with a background in applied mathematics, applied science, statistics, computer science, engineering, economics, or other similar quantitative fields. Applicants from other disciplines with strong academic performance may also be considered. We are looking for individuals for whom the programme is a good \"career-fit\", and who are likely to have successful future careers. Above all, you will need to demonstrate that you have the commitment, experience, motivation, and potential to benefit from, and contribute to, the programme.\nIndividuals who hold a good undergraduate degree can apply for admission to the programme. GRE or GMAT is a compulsory requirement for admission to this programme. Work experience is preferred but not mandatory. Please click\nhere\nfor details on admission requirements.\nUnder rolling admissions, applications are reviewed as they are received, rather than after a fixed deadline. This means that the earlier you apply, the sooner your application will be reviewed and you may receive an admission decision. Early application improves your chances of being shortlisted sooner and increases the likelihood of securing a place in the programme and being considered for scholarships.\nThough there is no specific degree requirement, most students will have undergraduate or graduate degrees in applied science, statistics, mathematics, engineering, computer science or other similar quantitative fields. Applicants from other disciplines will also be considered. The common requirement for all students in the programme is that they enter it with a high level of intellectual curiosity and a strong interest in finance.\nThe MFE programme is highly quantitative. While the math background of our students varies, most have taken engineering-level math courses beyond Calculus such as Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. If you have not done much math during your undergraduate study, you should be able to demonstrate your mathematical ability through other ways such as GMAT/GRE, good GCE ‘A’ Level (or high school equivalent) math, or work experience.\nGMAT or GRE is required and a good GMAT or GRE score would enhance your application. The GMAT or GRE score provides us with another platform to evaluate your application especially if academic results, work experience, etc are not comparable with other\napplicants. Please note that a low GMAT or GRE score will not exclude your application from being considered. There is no minimum cut-off score for GMAT or GRE. Either the GMAT or GRE is accepted. Original copies of the test scores are required. You\nmust have taken the test within the last five years of submitting your application.\nNote: GMAT/GRE scores are optional for NTU, SPMS graduates with Honours (Distinction) degree and above.\nNo, every applicant is required to take GMAT/GRE, regardless of their academic background, prior qualifications or work experience. We receive many international applications, so it is very helpful to have one measure on which we can compare all candidates\nin the applicant pool.\nNote: GMAT/GRE scores are optional for NTU, SPMS graduates with Honours (Distinction) degree and above.\nIf you hold a PhD in a related discipline and are able to submit a photocopy of the GMAT/GRE that was part of your original PhD application, you may then request a waiver of the GMAT/GRE test requirement. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Admissions Committee.\nIf the rest of your application is completed, you can send it to us, even if you have not taken the GMAT/GRE. However, you should take the test before the closing deadline which is the end of February. You should also indicate in the application form your GMAT/GRE test date so that we know when to expect your score report. We will not process your application without your GMAT/GRE score as your application is deemed incomplete without them. You should fax us your unofficial scores as soon as you receive them and arrange with the test centre for the official score report to be sent to us.\nYes, you may. Although work experience is preferred, it is not a mandatory requirement.\nTOEFL is required if the medium of instruction during your undergraduate studies was not in English. IELTS may be accepted in place of TOEFL.\nAn acceptable score for TOEFL is 600 (paper based), 250 (computer based) and 100 (internet based). For IELTS, the acceptable score is 6.5 and above.\nYes, this programme is open to international students. The university will assist you in obtaining your student visas and accommodation needs when you have confirmed acceptance to the programme.\nYes, non-Singaporeans who are currently working in Singapore and holding an employment pass may apply to take the programme on part-time basis.\nOnly those who are successful after the initial shortlisting process are invited for an interview.\nThe programme offers approximately 45-50 vacancies each year.\nYes, you may request for a deferment. However, you must accept the course offer and make the enrolment deposit before request for a deferment can be made.\nWe only have one intake each year in July.\nDue to high volume of applications received, we are unable to accede to requests for reasons of non-acceptance.\nProgramme Structure\nPlease click\nhere\nfor more information on the period of candidature.\nPlease click\nhere\nfor\nour academic calendar.\nExemptions are considered on a case-by-case basis. Students may apply for exemption of up to a maximum of three subjects. Application for exemptions will open once you are enrolled.\nYou are expected to attend all the lectures and classes scheduled for each of the core and elective courses.  You will need to set aside considerable amount of time for preparation, reading, group work, project work, private study, completion of assignments and revision for exams. The pace at which individuals work will obviously vary, but as a general rule of thumb, students will need to put in two to three hours of work outside of the classroom for every hour spent in the formal sessions.\nYou will have to set aside about S$6,500-S$8,000 for travelling, accommodation and living expenses. We will assist you in visa application, travel and accommodation arrangements. Part-time students are required to have their employers' consent to undertake the final term of 7 weeks at Carnegie-Mellon University before confirming acceptance into the programme. Please indicate on the application form should there be any difficulties in getting your employer's consent.\nFees & Scholarship\nPlease click\nhere\nfor more information on our fees\nThere are very limited scholarships available. Please visit the website for detailed information. The majority of our full-time students have taken the Tuition Fee Loan. This is available to local and foreign students. Please click\nhere\nfor more information on Financial Aid & Scholarship.\nNo, the CPF Board does not allow your CPF to be used for our graduate programmes.\nCareers\nGraduates from our MFE programme work primarily in the financial services industry. Careers vary but usually revolve around risk management, quantitative asset management, product structuring, quantitative trading, quantitative research, financial information technology as well as other areas in high-technology finance. Employers include investment banks, commercial banks, financial consultants, financial and database software suppliers, financial regulators, treasure and finance departments of MNCs, exchanges and energy companies.\nThe MSc Financial Engineering (MFE) programme at Nanyang Business School is well-known and has a good reputation in the industry. Our graduates have made a significant impact in the financial industries locally and internationally. Based on recent years’ records, majority of our graduates were able to secure an offer within three months after graduation with career advancement and/or a change of industry/ role. Many of the graduates have joined teams in top-tier financial institutions which increasingly require talents with quantitative knowledge and skillsets. During term time, many MFE students were also able to secure internship opportunities from our employer partners to gain practical experiences.\nOur students’ career development is well supported by the Nanyang Business School's Graduate Students Career Development Office (GSCDO). GSCDO is set up to guide students through their career development journey during their study as well as to build partnership with employers in different industries.
