        "content": "Greetings from the Graduate Studies Career Development Office, better known as GSCDO.\nNanyang Business School is viewed as a key recruiting partner by many Fortune 500 corporations and social impact organisations. And here at GSCDO, we work hard to prepare our postgraduate participants for the workforce.\nA dedicated go-to career counsellor looks after each graduate programme, working with our participants in a multitude of areas such as career planning, job hunting strategies, and linking participants to industry and alumni contacts. All of our career counsellors hail from industry and they bring with them deep insights into, and strong connections within, industries of interest to our participants.\nGSCDO also curates a suite of career workshops, covering important topics such as professional etiquette, networking, resume writing, and interview preparation.  These are aimed at ensuring that participants meet the high demands of employers and stand out from the competition.\nOur efforts have yielded good returns – each year, we achieve high employment rates for all our programmes. Our participants have proceeded to join top companies such as Amazon, Apple, BCG, Deloitte Consulting, GE, GIC, Goldman Sachs, Hilti, McKinsey & Company, Microsoft, P&G, PWC, and Shopee, to name a few.\nThe GSCDO team looks forward to welcoming you to the NBS graduate programme and starting the career journey with you. With your effort and our support, we believe that you will find the NBS days a rewarding journey indeed!\nAssoc Prof Ivy Kwan\nAssistant Dean (Career Service)\nGraduate Studies Career Development Office\nAt GSCDO, we are a team of professionals dedicated to supporting your career journey. Whether this is finding that ideal role, starting a business, or switching career tracks, we are ready to support and help open doors to this goal.\nWe\nGuide\nyou to better understand your passion, strengths, and motivations; and\nSupport\nyou as you push your own boundaries and set your targets. Our role is to\nCatalyse\nself-belief, and help you\nDevelop\nan empowering plan which\nOpen\ndoors to your career goal.\nThis partnership starts when you are enrolled with NBS and stays long after your graduation.\nA team dedicated to supporting you in crafting, defining, and achieving your career goals, the Graduate Studies Career Development Office is contactable at\n[email protected]\nand is located at\n50 Nanyang Avenue, S3.1-B2-06, Singapore 639798.\nNot just your average contact point for internships and full-time jobs, the Career Office genuinely cares about my development and career aspirations.  Indeed, the Career Office is the most valuable support I have gained out of my Nanyang MBA programme.  The team has been supportive and provided me with practical resources that I could leverage to become a well-rounded professional.\nA series of workshops were planned right from the start.  These workshops were relevant in helping me make informed decisions about my career, apart from equipping me with career-building skills that could effectively develop my professional brand image. There were also networking sessions that provided avenues for me to connect with alumni and industry experts.\nKimberly Liew Bei Xin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nAs a sponsored participant with my career locked in for the next few years, I was initially sceptical about how the Career Office could add value to my learning journey with NBS. However, my scepticism was debunked during orientation, when I understood how the Career Office partnered each participant through a structured career journey during our time with NBS and beyond.\nFrom resume building and profiling activities to customised workshops in topics ranging from personal branding to sharing developments within specific industries and sectors, I saw how the Career Office worked to cater to the diverse needs and interests of every participant.\nI took part in some of these workshops and picked up skills which I believe would remain relevant to me throughout my career. What I have also found beneficial was the one-to-one career coaching sessions, from which I not only gained clarity over my career purpose, but also gleaned valuable insights about areas to work on for my personal growth.\nAnthony Chor Xingyou\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nThe Career Office works with participants one-on-one to provide tailored career services through skill workshops, networking sessions, career coaching, and many more. The team also provides many exclusive resources for both full-time and part-time job opportunities.\nI personally found my internship through the Career Office’s network and support, including resume workshops, company visits, and personal coaching sessions. With the strong support, I can rest assured that the Nanyang MBA program will help me elevate my career to the next level.\nChris Lin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nI first learnt about the Career Office during orientation. Since then, I have interacted closely with the team in the office and gained guidance in fine-tuning my resume and understanding potential roles for me to explore.\nThe office also organised networking events and seminars which were helpful in getting me career ready. My favourite has been the personal branding workshop, which helped me better communicate and present who I am.\nA key highlight was also the personal career coach who worked with me to leverage my transferable skills and move into my ideal roles. The Career Office is indeed one’s best friend during this NBS journey, helping set NBS apart from other global MBA programmes.\nLorybeth Rugay Baldrias-Serrano\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nI deeply appreciate the support of the NBS Career Office in guiding me along the job search process.  My career counsellor helped alleviate the apprehension I felt about job interviews. Feedback during mock interviews and from video sessions helped me gain a lot of self-awareness, and I am now more confident of myself during interviews.\nThe Career Office has also been fabulous in tapping into the rich pool of alumni, which NBS has. Through alumni engagement sessions, I had the chance to hear the experience of those now working in companies such as Microsoft, Twitter, Goggle, and P&G. The experience and perspectives shared by these alumni have given me a clearer understanding of my career prospects, and I am deeply grateful to the Career Office for this.\nZhu Siyi\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nReturning to school for a postgraduate degree was a big decision, so I was hoping that the choice of NBS would make sense from both the academic and career angles. I have to say that the Career Office did not disappoint. The activities planned by the Office were well thought through and synced with the recruitment cycles of hiring companies.\nI have benefitted immensely from the help of my career counsellor who gave me career guidance and helped review my resume. The career counsellor simplified the world of internship for me and linked me to available internship opportunities. Knowing that the Career Office is ever ready to support me in my journey is a fantastic feeling and a big assurance to my life in NBS!\nZhang Yuejiao\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2021\nThe decision to leave a full-time job to pursue further studies during a global pandemic was certainly a major decision in my life. My choice of university was very much influenced by what its career office could offer, as I had positive experience with my career office during my undergraduate days in India. I was convinced that NTU was the right choice for me when I attended a programme briefing and the NBS Career Office gave useful information on the support level offered to participants of the programme.\nHaving embarked on the programme with NBS, I must say that the Career Office was everything I expected it to be, and more. The career counsellors in the Office were helpful and encouraging, and organised numerous talks to help participants understand our career options within different functions. Networking sessions with alumni and corporate partners widened our network for job opportunities.\nThe Career Office was also constantly sourcing for internships, and it was through one of these that I got my role with Johnson Controls Innovation Center. The support and guidance from the team has also helped me sharpen my career goals too. I am sure the invaluable support from the Office will continue into the future.\nVivek Goyal\nMSc Business Analytics Class of 2021\nComing from a university in the UK, I had assumed that career offices across all universities would offer similar services. I can now say with confidence that not all offices are the same – the proactive stance of the NBS Career Office sets it apart from the rest.\nApart from \"standard\" services like resume reviews and provision of a jobs portal, the approachable team in the NBS Career Office works to improve employability of every participant. From the start of my term, I worked with my career counsellor on a career development plan.\nWhat I also liked was the open-door policy of the Career Office, wherein I was able to approach any of the counsellors within the team to get insights into various sectors of interest.\nThe office also worked with other experts to equip participants with critical skills – my favourite was one where I learnt how to tell a better story about myself!\nOverall, the Careers team has impressed me with their future-oriented mindset and genuine passion in helping participants. I would recommend any participant interested in improving his or her employability to have a chat with their career counsellor soon!\nDaniel Rivera\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nI did my research prior to taking up my MBA programme. Institutional reputation, extent of alumni network and support of the career office were important considerations for me. For these reasons, I chose the Nanyang MBA. I am glad I did – to this day, I still ask the Career Office for advice on career because I trust them!\nWhen I started the Nanyang MBA, I did not know anyone in Singapore and had no idea how to go about searching for jobs in this country. Raised in Korea and having only worked in Europe, I benefitted immensely from the guidance given by the Career Office in a variety of areas, such as how to introduce myself over LinkedIn, how to get the most out of networking sessions, and how to pitch myself to prospective employers.\nThe Career Office also gave me the opportunity to meet with alumni and their stories of overcoming challenges, similar to what I faced, were very reassuring for me. My confidence in the Career Office was further strengthened when company recruiters attested to the level of effort put in by the Career Office in helping every participant get noticed by hiring managers. The team indeed showed true passion and they are the biggest asset from my NBS days!\nElla Choi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2018\nAPAC IT Data Project Manager, L’Oréal\nThe support provided by the Career Office was immensely helpful throughout my NBS journey. The Career Office lined up a series of workshops to get our resumes ready and equip us with essential interview skills even before we stepped into our first class. Throughout the semesters, the Career Office would also invite guest speakers from various companies to share experiences and provide valuable insights to help us make better and more informed career choices.\nWhat really helped was how the Career Office kept an eye out for opportunities for every participant, whether in the form of internships or full-time roles. This personalised approach was what helped me land my current role.\nThe Career Office was a key supporter through my journey with NBS, and I am glad that I made full use of the open-door policy of the team to get career coaching and counselling. These sessions were definitely more useful than I had initially thought!\nNigel Ng\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2020\nAnalyst, RV Capital\nMy Nanyang Professional MBA journey was truly enriching and fruitful. I received tremendous support in one-to-one coaching and in accessing career opportunities.  I also attended networking sessions and was notified of different job openings and recruitment sessions by renowned companies in various sectors.\nThanks to the Career Office, I successfully secured an interesting job, working directly with high-level stakeholders from around the region. It was through the Career Office that I got the opportunity to interview for this new role, in an industry which I had no prior professional experience in.\nIt was indeed a rare opportunity made possible by the Nanyang Professional MBA and the Career Office, for which I am extremely grateful.\nCheryl Chong\nNanyang Professional MBA Class of 2020\nBusiness Analyst, South Asia Country Group Management & Asia Sales and Client Management, Willis Towers Watson\nGraduating during the COVID-19 pandemic was unnerving, but the support of the Career Office made all the difference.\nFrom the start of the programme, I was given the opportunity to network with alumni and gained valuable insights into different industries and interview processes of several companies.  I also had a career coach who helped me uncover my true passion and worked with me to brand myself around who I truly am.\nWorking with the Career Office as a partner certainly helped me get the most out of my Nanyang MBA with NBS.\nLam Hao Zhi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2020\nManagement Associate, Dole Food Company\nDeloitte’s partnership with the Nanyang Business School (NBS) is a longstanding one. Graduates of NBS are well positioned to be the next generation of leaders, and we have had great success hiring NBS graduates for positions across our organisation. In the course of their work, they exhibit drive, professionalism and the willingness to learn – attributes that are essential in today’s dynamic workplace. We look forward to a continued relationship with NBS and help their graduates make an impact that matters in their roles at Deloitte.\nSeah Gek Choo\nDeloitte Singapore\nNTU and NBS have always been one of the most important university partners for JD.com in Singapore. Thanks to the dedication and support from the career services team at NBS, over the past years JD.com has organised many successful campus engagement events such as the NTU campus recruitment talk/interview day and the virtual JD open day, which attracted many NTU graduates who have become key talents at JD.com. We look forward to deepening our collaboration with NTU and NBS, and always welcome future NTU talent to the JD.com family.\nHan Huixian\nCampus Recruitment Manager, JD.com\nThe team in the Career Office has been highly proactive in maintaining connections with me.  I have been offered various opportunities to interact with and contribute back to the business school.

The first half of the course focuses on financial reporting. The emphases are on the nature of accounting information and its uses and limitations. While the focus of the course is on the users' perspective, it is essential that the user understands the building blocks of accounting, the process by which the information is generated and the incentives underlying the preparation of the accounting information. A proper understanding of the accounting process would enable the user to understand the limitations of the accounting information, and to ask the appropriate questions when using the\ninformation.\nIn the second half of the course, we seek to understand how accounting information is used in planning, costing, decision making, and management control. The organizational architecture will be used as the organizing framework. The major topics covered include activity-based costing and management, tools for decision making such as cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, and performance evaluation and measurement including a discussion on sustainability issues and measurement\nof these objectives.\nQuantitative skills are important to measure and quantify the financial effects of business strategies.\nThus, good financial analysis of business issues is critical to improve business decisions.\nCourse Description:\nThis course introduces to the participants the key concepts of analytics, which are of growing importance within the modern organization. Participants will be introduced to the process and tools relating to business analytics. Using real-life case studies, participants will be given the opportunity to have hands-on experience on building analytical models that will guide decision marking for common business problems such as profit and revenue forecast, customer segmentation, and consumer trend analysis.\nThis course systematically introduces the process of developing a strong business analytic case starting from the exploration of the data context to finally obtaining the explanatory or predictive results. The participants will learn how to ask the right questions and how to draw inferences from the data by using the appropriate statical and data mining tools.\nOverall, the course will enable participants to approach business problems data-analytically, envision business analytics opportunities in organizations, and follow up on ideas or opportunities that present themselves.\nCourse Description:\nCorporate Governance & Ethics (CG&E) aims to further stimulate the mindset of leaders to balance the key, often conflicting priorities they face in leadership, in business, government and/or the not-for-profit work environment. The aim is to help you develop strategies to make difficult but crucial organizational decisions considering the dynamic external environment.\nCG&E seeks to provide insights into what it takes to develop and/or strengthen an effective governance structure to allow the organization to meet increasingly challenging goals aligned with different stakeholders’ sometimes conflicting needs. We will discuss pertinent and topical issues to provoke participants to think about what accountability and responsible risk-taking really mean and foster an understanding of incorporating and embedding ethical practices in your strategy.\nWe will cover Ethical Leadership; Corporate Social Responsibility; Anti-Bribery & Corruption and Corporate Governance.\nCourse Description:\nThis course is an intensive introduction to the principles and practice of financial management that managers should understand. The course orientation will be from practitioners’ point of view to make the content applicable to daily business decisions. The course will be taught through lectures, class discussion and case studies. Topics to cover include:\nTime value of money and its business applications\nThe importance of cashflows and how to calculate cashflows\nCapital budgeting decision\nCost of capital usage in financial strategy and how to estimate it\nFinancial planning\nManagement of short-term assets and liabilities\nCourse Description:\nIf I had my way, this course would be re-titled “Revolutionary Marketing in the Age of Turbulence, Hyper-competition, and Disruption”, because the environment in which businesses operate today is businesses (and even entire industries) face. In such an environment, marketing practices need to be nothing short of revolutionary. And in these extraordinary times, marketing can (and should) no longer be taught in a traditional manner. Gone are the days when companies could simply rely on efficient manufacturing operations to mass-produce products and on predictable processes to mass-advertise and distribute those products. Gone are the days when marketing was the job of a department whose executives could simply examine broad customer segments within well-defined product markets using structured survey reports. And gone are the days when the only “customers ”; brand owners needed to deal with and worry about were the distributors and resellers who did most of the nitty-gritty work of serving the end consumers and/or end users. Marketing today is much less predictable, much more cross-functional (and, indeed, much more a direct responsibility of the CEO), and much more fundamentally about, interacting and connecting with the end consumers and users.\nBut at the same time, marketing today is more important, exciting, and fun!\nThis course will approach the study of marketing from highly contemporary perspectives. Course activities will include discussions of marketing issues that have emerged “just yesterday” and marketing events that have occurred “this morning”. We will discuss the latest marketing challenges that companies face, and many examples of successful and unsuccessful marketing strategies, particularly of companies/brands in Asia. There will also be a “live” project sponsored by a company that will offer a unique opportunity for participants to work on solving a live marketing problem. In addition, as part of the “Marketing 2022 Case Study” series, we will examine companies’ marketing strategies from a future-oriented perspective. Participants, whether they are already experienced marketing professionals or are complete novices at marketing, can look forward to gaining profound insight into the role of marketing in today’s business organizations as well as practical knowledge of how to successfully lead the marketing function of a progressive, thriving, and growth-oriented business.\nCourse Description:\nCompanies, investors, and governments are under increasing pressure to change the way they interact with people and planet--to adopt more sustainable practices.  These changes do not come for free, however, but rather they may involve considerable monetary and non-monetary costs.  This course introduces students to the three pillars of sustainable  nance:  companies that have to do the work to become more sustainable, investors that provide the  nancing while accommodating a wide range of attitudes towards sustainability, and governments that set regulations to incentivize good--and discourage bad--behaviors.  Throughout the course we will review current developments around the world, re ecting the fact that companies and countries may be moving in different directions and at a different pace.  For example, case studies will draw from cutting-edge legislation in Europe and follow-on efforts in ASEAN that re ect the vastly different starting point of less-developed economies.  Interactive lectures will provide opportunity for class participation as well as short individual and group exercises.\nCourse Description:\nThe aim of this course is to determine and understand forces impacting the global financial market. It treats central banking policy as a major force in shaping capital movements and market dynamics. Some of the questions the course will attempt to answer are: How do central banking policies impact the global financial market? What are key economic and market indicators that can help us determine the direction of the financial market. Participants interested in a career in of asset and wealth management, capital markets and trading should take this course.\nCourse Description:\nOperations is the core of the business that is concerned with the design, operation and improvement of systems concerned with the production of goods and services. Operations account for a significant percentage of the value added and cost in any business. Therefore, even a small advantage in operations can make the difference between winners and losers in a competitive marketplace.\nContent Description:\nThis course focuses on the strategic thinking process that helps companies achieve sustained high performance. It includes a continual and integrative process of \"making sense\" of internal and external situations, \"making choices\" to capture value at the corporate and business levels, \"making it happen\" to achieve the desired future status of the company, and \"making revisions\" to adapt to unexpected situations. It thus deals with the essential issues for short and long-term competitive positions and the primary responsibility of senior decision-makers in a company.\nThe course begins with a fundamental strategic question of what it takes to build a sustained high-performance organization. A review of classic studies on the subject leads to the first task of \"sensing strategic situations\", which introduces tools to analyse external and internal situations facing a company. While the external analysis helps managers to understand the trends in macro environments, competitive situations and competitors' behaviours, the internal analysis tries to identify and develop the source of core competences and sustained advantages. The course then moves to the task of \"making strategic choices\" at the business and corporate levels that are to secure competitive advantages in a specific market and to expand the boundary of the firm for sustained long-term growth, respectively. The next topic addresses strategy implementation, involving the tasks of \"making it happen\" and \"making revisions\". This subject discusses the content of strategy execution, organizational structure, and strategic transformation. The course concludes by discussing how to manage sustained firm growth in emerging markets that are much different from the developed markets in institutional settings, market dynamics, and consumer behaviours.\nCorporate purpose and high-performance organizations\nIndustry and competitive analysis\nCourse Description:\nThe course is organised and presented from the perspective of managerial end users of IT. It is designed to prepare future business executives for proactive leadership roles and responsibilities in a world which is being constantly challenged and\nshaped by IT and other digital technologies.\nThe course focuses on concepts and applications rather than on specific technologies, techniques, or methodologies. The emphasis is on the development of enabling frameworks and conceptual models for better understanding of the deployment of IT and\nthe Internet. The course makes liberal use of examples, case studies and other illustrations to provide examples of best practices and success stories. In this regard, the participants, who come from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, are encouraged\nto share their own experiences and views.\nCourse Description:\nCorporate Sustainability deals with strategies, activities, processes and structures that can help organizations sustain themselves as well as their people, natural resources and communities for the long run.\nThe negative impact created on the society and environment by industrial operations has resulted in increasing pressures from NGOs, civil society, and other stakeholders on corporations to adopt more sustainable and socially responsible practices in all their activities - right from sourcing to distribution, and to how the products and packaging is handled at the end of a use cycle. Corporate sustainability and responsibility have therefore become a key concern for the board members, shareholders as well as market regulators. Sustainability reporting is now a requirement in many countries, including Singapore.\nThough climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humankind, the United Nations in consultation with various stakeholders have developed 17 Sustainable development goals that firms are encouraged to pursue. A firm can mitigate the negative impact of its operations on the environment and the community through innovation and by adoption of appropriate technologies and methodologies.\nCourse Description:\nColonization and annexation of other states through military conquests were used historically to extend a nation’s theatre of influence, and to extract maximum benefits from its subsequent vassal states. Today, a country can exert its influence on other nation states through various methods beyond the conventional military option. This, in essence, is what geopolitics is all about, and it has tremendous implications on the relations among nation states as well as on how business corporations operate, especially in this highly inter-connected world.\nThe conventional “within-the-box” decision-making for a company is no longer tenable nor sustainable. With the fast changing and increased influence of politics into business (e.g. the Huawei saga, the blacklisting of many Chinese high-technology companies by the US government, the formation of new blocs like AUKUS, increased tension in South China Sea, etc.), companies that have international operations have realized that they need to be aware of the mega trends and geopolitical factors that can impact their corporate strategies. The need and urgency to take a holistic and long- term view, especially to factor in political “interventions” by various foreign governments, is now a reality that business corporations must learn to face. The increased conflict between China and the US is a very illustrative example. Started as a trade conflict between the two countries, it has escalated to other areas of conflicts, and a new cold war is fast developing. Under President Joe Biden, the US have lobbied aggressively Western countries like Britain, Australia, and Canada, and even Asian countries like Japan and India, into their “fight” against China. All these, inevitably, have boiled down to geopolitical wars between these Western allies against China, and the latter has also stepped up its campaigns and lobbies against the Western world.\nThis half-module course will cover real-life and current geopolitical issues of the day, and how they impact business policy. As China and US are the two major and most significant players that will influence the future of the world, including how they are extending their respective global influence, a significant portion of this course will pivot towards addressing issues between these two super-powers. The course will conclude with some pointers on how companies could respond to the various geopolitical challenges.\nThe contents of the course will include, but not limited to the following topics:\nUnderstanding geopolitics and the impact on business operations\nUnderstanding the different kinds of geopolitical risks and how to manage them\nDeveloping effective business policies via insightful geopolitical world\nAssessing the changing trends and landscape in the geopolitical world\nAnalysis and implications of the China-US conflict and their impact on the rest of the world and business operations\nUnderstanding the tools/vehicles that can be used for geopolitics\nDevelop a holistic and long-term perspective of the symbiotic relationship between business and geopolitics\nAs part of the learning process, each group of participants will be given the opportunity to \"deep-dive\" into specific geopolitical issues/topics that affect business operations and will present their findings in allocated class discussions/presentations during the course. This will form a very rich and insightful learning experience for all participants.\nCourse Description:\nChange is the only constant in our uncertain and volatile global environment. Successful organizations skilfully, initiate, embrace, and crystalize the learning that comes from change. The result is competitive advantage that can be sustained from the short to long term. This course is designed for aspiring change agents: People who lead, manage, and facilitate the change process as decision makers, managers, and consultants. We will adopt a mix of business case experience and theoretical frameworks to understand how businesses succeed or fail in initiating, navigating, and sustaining change. We will analyse both regional and international business contexts and the human, systemic, economic, and environmental forces that both necessitate and impede the change process within them. Our journey will take us into the minds of leaders of some of the world’s most prominent and recognized organizations, where we will examine their cultures, systems, decision, and psychology at work. In-class exercises will expose individual mindsets and approaches to managing change, to improve self-awareness of the type of change agents we can be. Participants will be challenged to analyse change as a complex multi-faceted phenomenon, learning to consider issues related to (a) recognizing the need for change; (b) targeting what needs to be changed; (c) dealing with people issues related to change; (d) planning, implementing, and evaluating change; and (e) sustaining change.\nCourse Description:\nThe objective of this course is to study corporate mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and restructurings and the strategic, valuation, financial, governance and other issues related to these activities. The course is case study based. The cases to be discussed in the course include those involving mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts/management buyouts, divestitures, spin offs and privatisations.\nCourse Description:\nBlockchain is a decentralized and transparent ledger technology. It offers a distributed and secure approach of verifying, storing, and managing data. As part of the suite of technologies expected to drive digital transformation, blockchain has the potential to transform the way of doing business across industries. This technology may disrupt how organizations are managed, how they create value, and even how they interact across their value chains. There are many strategic issues in designing business models and operations when blockchain is implemented. This course provides the foundation for students to learn about key characteristics and various use cases for blockchain, as well as enabling students to understand business opportunities, challenges, and even the dark side associated with implementation of blockchain.\nCourse Description:\nWith the growing threats of technological disruption, the race for digital transformation has begun. However, many organizations are struggling to develop an effective approach to realize the value of their digital transformation efforts. Executives have diverse perspectives as to what “going digital” really means. 74% of respondents in a Forrester survey feel that their companies do not fully understand the potential of digital to change value creation. How do you reimagine the future to craft the digital business strategy? How do you drive digital transformation to get there?\nThis course seeks to deepen the understanding on various aspects of digital transformation. We will consolidate the state of digital transformation landscape and explore new opportunities and threats arising from emerging new technologies. We will also discuss the implications for business strategies and organizational transformation. Through discussion of actual cases of digital transformation, the salient features of these strategies are explicated. Issues such as organizational structuring for digital transformation, building of digital capabilities, cultivation of digital culture, and the measurement of digital value creation are also addressed. Executives need to realize that successful digital transformation requires more than the pursuit of the latest technological innovation.\nThis course thus aims to deepen the understanding on digital transformation and unpack its variation under different contexts of technological disruption. Executives should develop a good appreciation that digital transformation requires much more than the pursuit of the latest technological innovation, and gain new insights on how they can embark on the digital transformation journey to begin building a more agile enterprise to be future-ready.\nCourse Description:\nThe Emerging Market Study Mission course is a course in the Professional MBA programme that aims to introduce students to an emerging market to provide them with practical understanding of the opportunities presented by emerging markets and conducting business in such a market. To do this, the school will be organising a 5-day segment overseas where students will undergo teaching sessions with faculty, guest speakers, visit companies and organisations in an emerging market, experience cultural immersion, and learn about regional business practices and trends.\nStrategy Projects At Nanyang (SPAN)\nis an educational collaboration between industry partners and Nanyang Business School.

There were also networking sessions that provided avenues for me to connect with alumni and industry experts.\nKimberly Liew Bei Xin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nAs a sponsored participant with my career locked in for the next few years, I was initially sceptical about how the Career Office could add value to my learning journey with NBS. However, my scepticism was debunked during orientation, when I understood how the Career Office partnered each participant through a structured career journey during our time with NBS and beyond.\nFrom resume building and profiling activities to customised workshops in topics ranging from personal branding to sharing developments within specific industries and sectors, I saw how the Career Office worked to cater to the diverse needs and interests of every participant.\nI took part in some of these workshops and picked up skills which I believe would remain relevant to me throughout my career. What I have also found beneficial was the one-to-one career coaching sessions, from which I not only gained clarity over my career purpose, but also gleaned valuable insights about areas to work on for my personal growth.\nAnthony Chor Xingyou\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nThe Career Office works with participants one-on-one to provide tailored career services through skill workshops, networking sessions, career coaching, and many more. The team also provides many exclusive resources for both full-time and part-time job opportunities.\nI personally found my internship through the Career Office’s network and support, including resume workshops, company visits, and personal coaching sessions. With the strong support, I can rest assured that the Nanyang MBA program will help me elevate my career to the next level.\nChris Lin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nI first learnt about the Career Office during orientation. Since then, I have interacted closely with the team in the office and gained guidance in fine-tuning my resume and understanding potential roles for me to explore.\nThe office also organised networking events and seminars which were helpful in getting me career ready. My favourite has been the personal branding workshop, which helped me better communicate and present who I am.\nA key highlight was also the personal career coach who worked with me to leverage my transferable skills and move into my ideal roles. The Career Office is indeed one’s best friend during this NBS journey, helping set NBS apart from other global MBA programmes.\nLorybeth Rugay Baldrias-Serrano\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nI deeply appreciate the support of the NBS Career Office in guiding me along the job search process.  My career counsellor helped alleviate the apprehension I felt about job interviews. Feedback during mock interviews and from video sessions helped me gain a lot of self-awareness, and I am now more confident of myself during interviews.\nThe Career Office has also been fabulous in tapping into the rich pool of alumni, which NBS has. Through alumni engagement sessions, I had the chance to hear the experience of those now working in companies such as Microsoft, Twitter, Goggle, and P&G. The experience and perspectives shared by these alumni have given me a clearer understanding of my career prospects, and I am deeply grateful to the Career Office for this.\nZhu Siyi\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nReturning to school for a postgraduate degree was a big decision, so I was hoping that the choice of NBS would make sense from both the academic and career angles. I have to say that the Career Office did not disappoint. The activities planned by the Office were well thought through and synced with the recruitment cycles of hiring companies.\nI have benefitted immensely from the help of my career counsellor who gave me career guidance and helped review my resume. The career counsellor simplified the world of internship for me and linked me to available internship opportunities. Knowing that the Career Office is ever ready to support me in my journey is a fantastic feeling and a big assurance to my life in NBS!\nZhang Yuejiao\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2021\nThe decision to leave a full-time job to pursue further studies during a global pandemic was certainly a major decision in my life. My choice of university was very much influenced by what its career office could offer, as I had positive experience with my career office during my undergraduate days in India. I was convinced that NTU was the right choice for me when I attended a programme briefing and the NBS Career Office gave useful information on the support level offered to participants of the programme.\nHaving embarked on the programme with NBS, I must say that the Career Office was everything I expected it to be, and more. The career counsellors in the Office were helpful and encouraging, and organised numerous talks to help participants understand our career options within different functions. Networking sessions with alumni and corporate partners widened our network for job opportunities.\nThe Career Office was also constantly sourcing for internships, and it was through one of these that I got my role with Johnson Controls Innovation Center. The support and guidance from the team has also helped me sharpen my career goals too. I am sure the invaluable support from the Office will continue into the future.\nVivek Goyal\nMSc Business Analytics Class of 2021\nComing from a university in the UK, I had assumed that career offices across all universities would offer similar services. I can now say with confidence that not all offices are the same – the proactive stance of the NBS Career Office sets it apart from the rest.\nApart from \"standard\" services like resume reviews and provision of a jobs portal, the approachable team in the NBS Career Office works to improve employability of every participant. From the start of my term, I worked with my career counsellor on a career development plan.\nWhat I also liked was the open-door policy of the Career Office, wherein I was able to approach any of the counsellors within the team to get insights into various sectors of interest.\nThe office also worked with other experts to equip participants with critical skills – my favourite was one where I learnt how to tell a better story about myself!\nOverall, the Careers team has impressed me with their future-oriented mindset and genuine passion in helping participants. I would recommend any participant interested in improving his or her employability to have a chat with their career counsellor soon!\nDaniel Rivera\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nI did my research prior to taking up my MBA programme. Institutional reputation, extent of alumni network and support of the career office were important considerations for me. For these reasons, I chose the Nanyang MBA. I am glad I did – to this day, I still ask the Career Office for advice on career because I trust them!\nWhen I started the Nanyang MBA, I did not know anyone in Singapore and had no idea how to go about searching for jobs in this country. Raised in Korea and having only worked in Europe, I benefitted immensely from the guidance given by the Career Office in a variety of areas, such as how to introduce myself over LinkedIn, how to get the most out of networking sessions, and how to pitch myself to prospective employers.\nThe Career Office also gave me the opportunity to meet with alumni and their stories of overcoming challenges, similar to what I faced, were very reassuring for me. My confidence in the Career Office was further strengthened when company recruiters attested to the level of effort put in by the Career Office in helping every participant get noticed by hiring managers. The team indeed showed true passion and they are the biggest asset from my NBS days!\nElla Choi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2018\nAPAC IT Data Project Manager, L’Oréal\nThe support provided by the Career Office was immensely helpful throughout my NBS journey. The Career Office lined up a series of workshops to get our resumes ready and equip us with essential interview skills even before we stepped into our first class. Throughout the semesters, the Career Office would also invite guest speakers from various companies to share experiences and provide valuable insights to help us make better and more informed career choices.\nWhat really helped was how the Career Office kept an eye out for opportunities for every participant, whether in the form of internships or full-time roles. This personalised approach was what helped me land my current role.\nThe Career Office was a key supporter through my journey with NBS, and I am glad that I made full use of the open-door policy of the team to get career coaching and counselling. These sessions were definitely more useful than I had initially thought!\nNigel Ng\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2020\nAnalyst, RV Capital\nMy Nanyang Professional MBA journey was truly enriching and fruitful. I received tremendous support in one-to-one coaching and in accessing career opportunities.  I also attended networking sessions and was notified of different job openings and recruitment sessions by renowned companies in various sectors.\nThanks to the Career Office, I successfully secured an interesting job, working directly with high-level stakeholders from around the region. It was through the Career Office that I got the opportunity to interview for this new role, in an industry which I had no prior professional experience in.\nIt was indeed a rare opportunity made possible by the Nanyang Professional MBA and the Career Office, for which I am extremely grateful.\nCheryl Chong\nNanyang Professional MBA Class of 2020\nBusiness Analyst, South Asia Country Group Management & Asia Sales and Client Management, Willis Towers Watson\nGraduating during the COVID-19 pandemic was unnerving, but the support of the Career Office made all the difference.\nFrom the start of the programme, I was given the opportunity to network with alumni and gained valuable insights into different industries and interview processes of several companies.  I also had a career coach who helped me uncover my true passion and worked with me to brand myself around who I truly am.\nWorking with the Career Office as a partner certainly helped me get the most out of my Nanyang MBA with NBS.\nLam Hao Zhi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2020\nManagement Associate, Dole Food Company\nDeloitte’s partnership with the Nanyang Business School (NBS) is a longstanding one.

We look forward to a continued relationship with NBS and help their graduates make an impact that matters in their roles at Deloitte.\nSeah Gek Choo\nDeloitte Singapore\nNTU and NBS have always been one of the most important university partners for JD.com in Singapore. Thanks to the dedication and support from the career services team at NBS, over the past years JD.com has organised many successful campus engagement events such as the NTU campus recruitment talk/interview day and the virtual JD open day, which attracted many NTU graduates who have become key talents at JD.com. We look forward to deepening our collaboration with NTU and NBS, and always welcome future NTU talent to the JD.com family.\nHan Huixian\nCampus Recruitment Manager, JD.com\nThe team in the Career Office has been highly proactive in maintaining connections with me.  I have been offered various opportunities to interact with and contribute back to the business school.

And here at GSCDO, we work hard to prepare our postgraduate participants for the workforce.\nA dedicated go-to career counsellor looks after each graduate programme, working with our participants in a multitude of areas such as career planning, job hunting strategies, and linking participants to industry and alumni contacts. All of our career counsellors hail from industry and they bring with them deep insights into, and strong connections within, industries of interest to our participants.\nGSCDO also curates a suite of career workshops, covering important topics such as professional etiquette, networking, resume writing, and interview preparation.  These are aimed at ensuring that participants meet the high demands of employers and stand out from the competition.\nOur efforts have yielded good returns – each year, we achieve high employment rates for all our programmes. Our participants have proceeded to join top companies such as Amazon, Apple, BCG, Deloitte Consulting, GE, GIC, Goldman Sachs, Hilti, McKinsey & Company, Microsoft, P&G, PWC, and Shopee, to name a few.\nThe GSCDO team looks forward to welcoming you to the NBS graduate programme and starting the career journey with you. With your effort and our support, we believe that you will find the NBS days a rewarding journey indeed!\nAssoc Prof Ivy Kwan\nAssistant Dean (Career Service)\nGraduate Studies Career Development Office\nAt GSCDO, we are a team of professionals dedicated to supporting your career journey.

There were also networking sessions that provided avenues for me to connect with alumni and industry experts.\nKimberly Liew Bei Xin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nAs a sponsored participant with my career locked in for the next few years, I was initially sceptical about how the Career Office could add value to my learning journey with NBS. However, my scepticism was debunked during orientation, when I understood how the Career Office partnered each participant through a structured career journey during our time with NBS and beyond.\nFrom resume building and profiling activities to customised workshops in topics ranging from personal branding to sharing developments within specific industries and sectors, I saw how the Career Office worked to cater to the diverse needs and interests of every participant.\nI took part in some of these workshops and picked up skills which I believe would remain relevant to me throughout my career. What I have also found beneficial was the one-to-one career coaching sessions, from which I not only gained clarity over my career purpose, but also gleaned valuable insights about areas to work on for my personal growth.\nAnthony Chor Xingyou\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nThe Career Office works with participants one-on-one to provide tailored career services through skill workshops, networking sessions, career coaching, and many more. The team also provides many exclusive resources for both full-time and part-time job opportunities.\nI personally found my internship through the Career Office’s network and support, including resume workshops, company visits, and personal coaching sessions. With the strong support, I can rest assured that the Nanyang MBA program will help me elevate my career to the next level.\nChris Lin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nI first learnt about the Career Office during orientation. Since then, I have interacted closely with the team in the office and gained guidance in fine-tuning my resume and understanding potential roles for me to explore.\nThe office also organised networking events and seminars which were helpful in getting me career ready. My favourite has been the personal branding workshop, which helped me better communicate and present who I am.\nA key highlight was also the personal career coach who worked with me to leverage my transferable skills and move into my ideal roles. The Career Office is indeed one’s best friend during this NBS journey, helping set NBS apart from other global MBA programmes.\nLorybeth Rugay Baldrias-Serrano\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nI deeply appreciate the support of the NBS Career Office in guiding me along the job search process.  My career counsellor helped alleviate the apprehension I felt about job interviews. Feedback during mock interviews and from video sessions helped me gain a lot of self-awareness, and I am now more confident of myself during interviews.\nThe Career Office has also been fabulous in tapping into the rich pool of alumni, which NBS has. Through alumni engagement sessions, I had the chance to hear the experience of those now working in companies such as Microsoft, Twitter, Goggle, and P&G. The experience and perspectives shared by these alumni have given me a clearer understanding of my career prospects, and I am deeply grateful to the Career Office for this.\nZhu Siyi\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nReturning to school for a postgraduate degree was a big decision, so I was hoping that the choice of NBS would make sense from both the academic and career angles. I have to say that the Career Office did not disappoint. The activities planned by the Office were well thought through and synced with the recruitment cycles of hiring companies.\nI have benefitted immensely from the help of my career counsellor who gave me career guidance and helped review my resume. The career counsellor simplified the world of internship for me and linked me to available internship opportunities. Knowing that the Career Office is ever ready to support me in my journey is a fantastic feeling and a big assurance to my life in NBS!\nZhang Yuejiao\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2021\nThe decision to leave a full-time job to pursue further studies during a global pandemic was certainly a major decision in my life. My choice of university was very much influenced by what its career office could offer, as I had positive experience with my career office during my undergraduate days in India. I was convinced that NTU was the right choice for me when I attended a programme briefing and the NBS Career Office gave useful information on the support level offered to participants of the programme.\nHaving embarked on the programme with NBS, I must say that the Career Office was everything I expected it to be, and more. The career counsellors in the Office were helpful and encouraging, and organised numerous talks to help participants understand our career options within different functions. Networking sessions with alumni and corporate partners widened our network for job opportunities.\nThe Career Office was also constantly sourcing for internships, and it was through one of these that I got my role with Johnson Controls Innovation Center. The support and guidance from the team has also helped me sharpen my career goals too. I am sure the invaluable support from the Office will continue into the future.\nVivek Goyal\nMSc Business Analytics Class of 2021\nComing from a university in the UK, I had assumed that career offices across all universities would offer similar services. I can now say with confidence that not all offices are the same – the proactive stance of the NBS Career Office sets it apart from the rest.\nApart from \"standard\" services like resume reviews and provision of a jobs portal, the approachable team in the NBS Career Office works to improve employability of every participant. From the start of my term, I worked with my career counsellor on a career development plan.\nWhat I also liked was the open-door policy of the Career Office, wherein I was able to approach any of the counsellors within the team to get insights into various sectors of interest.\nThe office also worked with other experts to equip participants with critical skills – my favourite was one where I learnt how to tell a better story about myself!\nOverall, the Careers team has impressed me with their future-oriented mindset and genuine passion in helping participants. I would recommend any participant interested in improving his or her employability to have a chat with their career counsellor soon!\nDaniel Rivera\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nI did my research prior to taking up my MBA programme. Institutional reputation, extent of alumni network and support of the career office were important considerations for me. For these reasons, I chose the Nanyang MBA. I am glad I did – to this day, I still ask the Career Office for advice on career because I trust them!\nWhen I started the Nanyang MBA, I did not know anyone in Singapore and had no idea how to go about searching for jobs in this country. Raised in Korea and having only worked in Europe, I benefitted immensely from the guidance given by the Career Office in a variety of areas, such as how to introduce myself over LinkedIn, how to get the most out of networking sessions, and how to pitch myself to prospective employers.\nThe Career Office also gave me the opportunity to meet with alumni and their stories of overcoming challenges, similar to what I faced, were very reassuring for me. My confidence in the Career Office was further strengthened when company recruiters attested to the level of effort put in by the Career Office in helping every participant get noticed by hiring managers. The team indeed showed true passion and they are the biggest asset from my NBS days!\nElla Choi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2018\nAPAC IT Data Project Manager, L’Oréal\nThe support provided by the Career Office was immensely helpful throughout my NBS journey. The Career Office lined up a series of workshops to get our resumes ready and equip us with essential interview skills even before we stepped into our first class. Throughout the semesters, the Career Office would also invite guest speakers from various companies to share experiences and provide valuable insights to help us make better and more informed career choices.\nWhat really helped was how the Career Office kept an eye out for opportunities for every participant, whether in the form of internships or full-time roles. This personalised approach was what helped me land my current role.\nThe Career Office was a key supporter through my journey with NBS, and I am glad that I made full use of the open-door policy of the team to get career coaching and counselling. These sessions were definitely more useful than I had initially thought!\nNigel Ng\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2020\nAnalyst, RV Capital\nMy Nanyang Professional MBA journey was truly enriching and fruitful. I received tremendous support in one-to-one coaching and in accessing career opportunities.  I also attended networking sessions and was notified of different job openings and recruitment sessions by renowned companies in various sectors.\nThanks to the Career Office, I successfully secured an interesting job, working directly with high-level stakeholders from around the region. It was through the Career Office that I got the opportunity to interview for this new role, in an industry which I had no prior professional experience in.\nIt was indeed a rare opportunity made possible by the Nanyang Professional MBA and the Career Office, for which I am extremely grateful.\nCheryl Chong\nNanyang Professional MBA Class of 2020\nBusiness Analyst, South Asia Country Group Management & Asia Sales and Client Management, Willis Towers Watson\nGraduating during the COVID-19 pandemic was unnerving, but the support of the Career Office made all the difference.\nFrom the start of the programme, I was given the opportunity to network with alumni and gained valuable insights into different industries and interview processes of several companies.  I also had a career coach who helped me uncover my true passion and worked with me to brand myself around who I truly am.\nWorking with the Career Office as a partner certainly helped me get the most out of my Nanyang MBA with NBS.\nLam Hao Zhi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2020\nManagement Associate, Dole Food Company\nDeloitte’s partnership with the Nanyang Business School (NBS) is a longstanding one.

In this module, you will have the unique\nopportunity to recommend projects from your company to the class.\nCourse Description\nThe aim of this course is to introduce the design and use of management accounting information for planning, control and decision making within business organisations. The organisational architecture will be used as the organizing framework. The major\ntopics covered in this course include product costing, activity-based costing and management, transfer pricing issues, tools for decision making such as cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, and performance evaluation and measurement. The course also\nincludes a discussion on sustainability issues and possible measurement of these objectives.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand managerial accounting concepts and terminology and learn about cost behaviour and cost classifications\nUnderstand the methods of product/service costing and why they are important\nBe able to apply the quantitative tools to various decisions faced by managers and for strategic planning\nUnderstand the various financial and non-financial performance measures and how they are used to establish effective control\nCourse Description\nThe global economy presents many opportunities and challenges for businesses and their leaders. Senior executives need to develop a repertoire of strategic leadership capabilities to remain effective. One of the most important capabilities needed is cultural\nintelligence (CQ) – the ability to function effectively across a variety of cultural contexts. This course will equip participants with a working understanding of Cultural intelligence (CQ) and its relevance to their industry and organisation.\nLearning Objectives\nTo understand the cultural intelligence framework and its implications for executives working in global industries\nTo enhance their awareness of their strengths and weaknesses in managing cross-cultural situations\nTo enhance their repertoire of strategic leadership capabilities\nTo develop a plan for enhancing cultural intelligence personally and throughout their organisation\nTo discern the different dimensions of national culture and the underlying assumptions of one’s own cultural perspective\nTo understand what culture is and the different spheres of culture (national, regional, industry, company, etc.)\nCourse Description\nThis course will focus on strategies for acquiring, managing, and retaining talent. Students will learn about different ways to think about “talent” and how to find, engage, and retain it to fulfil organisations’ strategic\nobjectives.  Some selected talent management theories and models will be complemented by “best practice” case studies and discussions of your own managerial experiences.\nCourse Description\nGlobal supply chains play a vital role in today’s economy because efficient and responsive supply chains not only help companies improve profitability but also allow customers to receive better products at lower prices and better\nservice levels. In this course, participants will learn the key techniques and strategies in managing global supply chains; namely, network design, inventory, and replenishment processes, designing efficient versus responsive supply chains, contracting\nand strategic procurement, and implications of emerging technologies. This knowledge will help participants to enhance supply chain efficiencies, manage economic risks, optimize network performance, and apply best practices and new technologies to\ncreate superior supply chain value.\nGlobal supply chains are critical building blocks in value creation for any organisation or industry. Managing them is a complex endeavour which would benefit from attention to detail in finding opportunities for performance improvement. This means that\nparticipants must first understand the nature, structure, challenges as well as drivers of supply chain performance. Thereafter, they will need to be exposed to best practices like modularization, postponement, among others, as well as to learn optimization\ntools such as network design and inventory control.\nLearning Objectives\nProvide an understanding and appreciation of key challenges and drivers in managing global supply chains\nExpose participants to techniques and strategies used to optimize supply chain decisions and to anticipate or explain supply chain phenomena\nCourse Description\nThe pervasiveness and impact of IT, in all its forms, is ubiquitous. Technological change and the speed, manifested in new devices and gadgets and software, is clear to all. What is more of a challenge is our ability to comprehend their subtle impacts\nand then of course to cope with them. What should businesses do and how can they prepare for this disruptive landscape? In an era where new traditional industries are being challenges by new technology competitors, where rules of the game are being\nchanged so dramatically that incumbents who were monopolies are going bankrupt, it is imperative to step back and take a fundamental look at the new economics of the digital world.\nThis course is about understanding such issues and to ultimately surface patterns of IT-driven change and strategies. Through case studies of multiple companies in varied industries, we will try and understand how IT is reshaping the economic landscape\nby offering new ways to gather information, compete based on value-added knowledge, and providing new ways to coordinate and connect.\nSince the Internet has motivated much of this disruption, our class discussions pertain to the context of online companies who in a short period of time have become giants in their own rights. And that is also because participants’ experience in\ntraditional industries then offers a rich context to contrast the old vs. the new, and that is the contribution expected of everyone in the class.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstanding important IT management issues and developments\nExamination of key technologies and their strategic value and disruptive potential\nExamine how companies are becoming more knowledge – driven and using innovation and intellectual property as strategic resources\nThe viability of technology-driven business opportunities – how value is created, what are the critical costs associated with creating this value, and to what extent a sustainable competitive advantage can be maintained that is based on IT\nCourse Description\nThe objective is to inculcate an understanding of the various functions of the financial manager and how these functions relate to the overall business of the firm. The major topics covered include risk and return, cost of capital, capital budgeting,\ncapital structure determination, and the dividend policy.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand the various aspects of financial management to maximize the value of the organisation\nEvaluate strategic choices involved in capital budgeting, including estimation of project cash flows, measurement of cost of capital and appropriate mix of various sources of funds\nCourse Description\nThis course is designed to help participants develop strong conceptual foundations for understanding design thinking and identifying opportunities in the latest technologies such as Blockchain and AI. It is important to recognize the\ndifferent types of technology innovations and the role that they play in organisations and society.\nThe latest technologies bring about many opportunities for firms. A sound understanding of the latest technologies, coupled with the design thinking framework that helps business leaders to understand how to spot business opportunities amidst the cry\nfor using such latest technologies, is critical for today’s leaders.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand fundamental concepts and principles of design thinking and how it is applied to various organisations\nLearn to apply different design research techniques for opportunity identification\nExamine how firms may utilize the latest technologies to leverage on business opportunities\nUnderstand the basics of blockchain and challenges with using and implementing the technology\nUnderstand the basics of AI, ethics of AI and the latest industry trends related to AI\nCourse Description\nThe brands that a firm has invested in and developed over time are typically their most valuable assets. Product designs, manufacturing processes and other business processes may be easily copied, but a strong brand is something that\ncannot be easily reproduced.\nMany Asian companies are coming to terms with the importance of branding and are putting more resources into building a strong brand. This is evident from the number of branding awards (e.g., Singapore Promising Brand Award, Readers’ Digest Most\nTrusted Brand Award etc) being handed out in recent years. Companies are also paying top dollars for branding managers.\nThis course aims to inform students about the current theories and findings on how firms manage brands and how consumers (in particular Asian consumers) view brands.\nLearning Objectives\nThis course aims to help participants acquire a good understanding of the branding strategies and factors affecting consumers’ reactions to these strategies. We will discuss how cultures may affect the effectiveness of different\nstrategies and how Asian consumers view brands in general.\nCourse Description\nThis course aims to develop your understanding of the main analytical techniques and conceptual frameworks to understand the drivers of profitability and change in industries and competitive markets.\nYou will also reflect and create a capability development roadmap to enhance your professional contribution and leadership to transform your organisations.\nLearning Objectives\nIntroduce participants to the concepts of strategy, value, and advantage\nDevelop an understanding of the main analytical techniques to assess firms’ competitive positions and apply them to specific situations\nDevelop an appreciation of the economic theory underlying strategic choices across the business and corporate strategies\nDifferentiate between business models and business strategy\nTo consider and discuss how strategic capabilities may be developed and deepened in your organisation so that you may achieve strategic outcomes for the organisation\nCourse Description\nThis course introduces to the participants the key concepts of analytics, which are of growing importance within the modern organisation. Participants will be introduced to the process and tools relating to business analytics. Using real-life\ncase studies, participants will be given the opportunity to have hands-on experience on building analytical models that will guide decision marking for common business problems such as profit and revenue forecast, customer segmentation, and consumer\ntrend analysis.\nThis course systematically introduces the process of developing a strong business analytic case starting from the exploration of the data context to finally obtaining the explanatory or predictive results. The students will learn how to ask the right\nquestions and how to draw inferences from the data by using the appropriate statistical and data mining tools.\nOverall, the course will enable students to approach business problems data-analytically, envision business analytics opportunities in organisations, and also follow up on ideas or opportunities that present themselves.\nLearning Objectives\nProblem formulation in business analytics\nIntroduce various statistical applications, tools and analytical applications which are applied in various business contexts\nDiscuss the various concepts and cases of statistical applications\nExamine supervised learning methods, such as classification and prediction\nExamine unsupervised learning methods, such as association rules and clustering\nCourse Description\nThe course aims to provide the participants an in-depth understanding of economic principles and the interactions between the macroeconomic policies and the private sector in the areas that are applicable to managers. The course covers\neconomic principles and content with 3 main focuses that are essential to the decision-making of business managers. Firstly, the course explains economic elements facing any business i.e. consumer behaviors of their clients and the business cost structure.\nSecondly, the course explains different market structures that firms are in with the aim of providing participants an ability to plan strategic response to successfully navigate the business. And lastly, the course explains interactions between some\nmajor government macroeconomic policies that their impact on the business and the society at large.\nThe course is designed with the audience who are business practitioners in mind. The focus will be on economic topics that business managers will need to incorporate into their analyses of the markets, industry structure, business-government interactions\nand business strategies suitable for competing under various market environments.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand how a rational individual makes economic decisions\nExplain important economic issues that enable students to understand the economic behaviours of their customers, and the plan competitive strategies suitable for their business environments\nEnable students to understand daily economic events they see in the media\nCourse Description\nWith the growing threats of technological disruption, the race for digital transformation has begun. However, many organisations are struggling to develop an effective approach to realize the value of their digital transformation efforts.\nExecutives have diverse perspectives as to what “going digital” really means. 74% of respondents in a Forrester survey also feel that their companies do not fully understand the potential of digital to change value creation. How do you\nreimagine the future to craft the digital business strategy? How do you drive digital transformation to get there?\nLearning Objectives\nThis course thus aims to deepen the understanding on digital transformation and unpack its variation under different contexts of technological disruption. Investing in more digital initiatives does not necessarily lead to a stronger digital\ntransformation strategy. Executives should develop a good appreciation that digital transformation requires much more than the pursuit of the latest technological innovation, and also gain new insights on HOW they can embark on the digital transformation\njourney to begin building a more agile enterprise to be future-ready.\nCourse Description\nNegotiation is essential not only in a professional or business context, but also in social and personal settings. Strong negotiation skills are therefore an important prerequisite for professional and personal success. You are a good\nnegotiator if you can get what you want from your negotiating counterparts; you are an excellent negotiator if those negotiating counterparts are happy to deal with you again. Good negotiation skills can be innate; excellent negotiation skills require\ncareful thought and attention to the process.\nThis module is designed to allow you to have a deeper understanding of your own negotiation strengths and weaknesses, to equip you with the tools and framework for analysing and preparing for negotiations, and to help you hone the negotiation skills so\ncrucial for success in leadership roles and in dealings with internal as well as external parties. This module adopts a variety of instructional methods, from lectures, videos and discussions to experiential learning through role-playing and simulation\nexercises.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand basic principles of negotiation\nUtilise a framework for negotiation\nPrepare for, and conduct, negotiations in a structured manner\nEstablish and maintain relationships in a negotiation\nAdapt negotiation strategies and tactics in different contexts and settings\nCourse Description\nThe rapid expansion of the Asian consumer market has prompted global multinationals to concentrate their efforts on building brands that have both global and local appeal.  In a region characterised by considerable cross-cultural\ndifferences, the need for accurate Asian market research (MR) has become a priority.  But with new products failing at a staggering 80% each year, companies are now turning to psychology and neuroscience to help them predict more accurately how\nconsumers will behave.\nOver the last few decades, neuroscientists have made remarkable progress in understanding how our brains shape and determine our behaviour. The introduction of brain scanners in the latter part of the last century allowed scientists to peer inside the\nhuman brain during normal behavior and uncover the mechanisms by which we feel, think and act. We now know that some 90% of our behavior is driven by subconscious brain processes and that our emotions, not our conscious thoughts, that are largely\nresponsible for the decisions we make.\nIn this module, students will learn how the new tools in the field of neuromarketing are being applied across a wide range of industry sectors and at all stages of the brand journey, to capture consumers’ implicit or subconscious feelings, biases\nand beliefs about products, brands and marketing messages. They will learn how memories are formed and influenced, how perception can be influenced by subtle environmental cues and how to measure and extract these powerful subconscious responses that\ncan predict subsequent purchasing behavior with greater accuracy than spoken feedback.\nAttendees will also learn about the pros and cons of the different neuromarketing tools, the questions that each method is typically best placed to address as well as how to commission research from practitioners in this field.\nLearning Objectives\nThe course is designed to provide students with a practical understanding of how psychological and neuroscientific (often referred to as “neuromarketing”) techniques can be applied at all stages of the brand journey to gain\ngreater insight into consumer behaviour and produce products and brands that have a much higher chance of succeeding in the marketplace.  This knowledge will be gained through lectures, group participation, demonstrations and exposure to actual\nmarketing briefs and guest speakers using these approaches across different industry sectors.\nCourse Description\nCorporate Sustainability deals with strategies, activities, processes and structures that can help organizations sustain themselves as well as their people, natural resources and communities for the long run.\nThe negative impact created on the society and environment by industrial operations has resulted in increasing pressures from NGOs, civil society, and other stakeholders on corporations to adopt more sustainable and socially responsible practices in all\ntheir activities - right from sourcing to distribution, and to how the products and packaging is handled at the end of a use cycle. Corporate sustainability and responsibility have therefore become a key concern for the board members, shareholders\nas well as market regulators. Sustainability reporting is now a requirement in many countries, including Singapore.\nA firm can mitigate the negative impact of its operations on the environment and the community through innovation and by adoption of appropriate technologies and methodologies.\nLearning Objectives\nHave an appreciation of the key issues in corporate sustainability\nUnderstand how to read sustainability reports and evaluate sustainability challenges in specific industries\nHave a good understanding of the specific issues in corporate sustainability that is covered in the class\nCourse Description\nThis course will explore the reasons and motivations for mergers and acquisitions and will examine the strategic considerations in planning and implementing a merger or acquisition, in either a friendly or hostile environment. The tools\nand techniques of valuation, including leverage buyout transactions will be reviewed. The acquisition process will be discussed in detail, including the confidentiality agreement, bid process, due diligence, closing and implementation. The aim is\nto provide an understanding of the strategic, cost, valuation, structure, financial, legal, accounting, negotiation and implementation issues associated with mergers and acquisitions.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand the underlying dynamics of M&A, including various motivating factors, the role of various participants, analysis of various merger waves and benefits to target and acquiring firms\nUnderstand various methods of valuations, including leverage buyouts\nDevelop understanding of strategic choices involved in acquisitions, including development of acquisition plans, payment methods, takeover defences and achieving value enhancing growth\nCourse Description\nThis course moves beyond the “myth” of the lone genius inventor/entrepreneur to highlight the reality of what Dr. Kurt Beyer calls Systems of Innovation.  Though individual inventors and entrepreneurs can be important\nagents of change, they are embedded in and dependent on a matrix of individuals, organisations, technologies, and institutions.\nLearning Objectives\nSilicon Valley Eco-system: The San Francisco Bay Area has been the technological innovation leader for over a half-century. We will explore the pillars of this unique geographic region\nTechnical Systems: We are surrounded by mature technical systems (gas-powered transportation), more recent technical systems (the internet), and emerging technical systems (digital currency).  We will learn the framework for how these systems\ncommence, grow, and mature\nEntrepreneurs: Bay Area entrepreneurs are playing a role in the unfolding of the 4th Industrial Revolution. We will learn how entrepreneurs evaluate opportunities, create strategies, manage risks, and reduce resource requirements through lean experimentation,\nstaged investing, and the use of related tactics\nCorporate Innovation: As companies grow and mature, they tend to lose the ability to innovate. We will explore the causes of this rigidness and consider ways for management to overcome it\nCourse Description\nThis course is all about maximizing human potential – your own, your team’s, and your organisation's. You will learn innovative leadership tools for establishing and managing prosperous firms while simultaneously creating\na thriving career for yourself. Leadership is about coordinating the skills, talents, and resources of individuals and groups in those combinations that best realize the organisation’s opportunities.

There were also networking sessions that provided avenues for me to connect with alumni and industry experts.\nKimberly Liew Bei Xin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nAs a sponsored participant with my career locked in for the next few years, I was initially sceptical about how the Career Office could add value to my learning journey with NBS. However, my scepticism was debunked during orientation, when I understood how the Career Office partnered each participant through a structured career journey during our time with NBS and beyond.\nFrom resume building and profiling activities to customised workshops in topics ranging from personal branding to sharing developments within specific industries and sectors, I saw how the Career Office worked to cater to the diverse needs and interests of every participant.\nI took part in some of these workshops and picked up skills which I believe would remain relevant to me throughout my career. What I have also found beneficial was the one-to-one career coaching sessions, from which I not only gained clarity over my career purpose, but also gleaned valuable insights about areas to work on for my personal growth.\nAnthony Chor Xingyou\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nThe Career Office works with participants one-on-one to provide tailored career services through skill workshops, networking sessions, career coaching, and many more. The team also provides many exclusive resources for both full-time and part-time job opportunities.\nI personally found my internship through the Career Office’s network and support, including resume workshops, company visits, and personal coaching sessions. With the strong support, I can rest assured that the Nanyang MBA program will help me elevate my career to the next level.\nChris Lin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nI first learnt about the Career Office during orientation. Since then, I have interacted closely with the team in the office and gained guidance in fine-tuning my resume and understanding potential roles for me to explore.\nThe office also organised networking events and seminars which were helpful in getting me career ready. My favourite has been the personal branding workshop, which helped me better communicate and present who I am.\nA key highlight was also the personal career coach who worked with me to leverage my transferable skills and move into my ideal roles. The Career Office is indeed one’s best friend during this NBS journey, helping set NBS apart from other global MBA programmes.\nLorybeth Rugay Baldrias-Serrano\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nI deeply appreciate the support of the NBS Career Office in guiding me along the job search process.  My career counsellor helped alleviate the apprehension I felt about job interviews. Feedback during mock interviews and from video sessions helped me gain a lot of self-awareness, and I am now more confident of myself during interviews.\nThe Career Office has also been fabulous in tapping into the rich pool of alumni, which NBS has. Through alumni engagement sessions, I had the chance to hear the experience of those now working in companies such as Microsoft, Twitter, Goggle, and P&G. The experience and perspectives shared by these alumni have given me a clearer understanding of my career prospects, and I am deeply grateful to the Career Office for this.\nZhu Siyi\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nReturning to school for a postgraduate degree was a big decision, so I was hoping that the choice of NBS would make sense from both the academic and career angles. I have to say that the Career Office did not disappoint. The activities planned by the Office were well thought through and synced with the recruitment cycles of hiring companies.\nI have benefitted immensely from the help of my career counsellor who gave me career guidance and helped review my resume. The career counsellor simplified the world of internship for me and linked me to available internship opportunities. Knowing that the Career Office is ever ready to support me in my journey is a fantastic feeling and a big assurance to my life in NBS!\nZhang Yuejiao\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2021\nThe decision to leave a full-time job to pursue further studies during a global pandemic was certainly a major decision in my life. My choice of university was very much influenced by what its career office could offer, as I had positive experience with my career office during my undergraduate days in India. I was convinced that NTU was the right choice for me when I attended a programme briefing and the NBS Career Office gave useful information on the support level offered to participants of the programme.\nHaving embarked on the programme with NBS, I must say that the Career Office was everything I expected it to be, and more. The career counsellors in the Office were helpful and encouraging, and organised numerous talks to help participants understand our career options within different functions. Networking sessions with alumni and corporate partners widened our network for job opportunities.\nThe Career Office was also constantly sourcing for internships, and it was through one of these that I got my role with Johnson Controls Innovation Center. The support and guidance from the team has also helped me sharpen my career goals too. I am sure the invaluable support from the Office will continue into the future.\nVivek Goyal\nMSc Business Analytics Class of 2021\nComing from a university in the UK, I had assumed that career offices across all universities would offer similar services. I can now say with confidence that not all offices are the same – the proactive stance of the NBS Career Office sets it apart from the rest.\nApart from \"standard\" services like resume reviews and provision of a jobs portal, the approachable team in the NBS Career Office works to improve employability of every participant. From the start of my term, I worked with my career counsellor on a career development plan.\nWhat I also liked was the open-door policy of the Career Office, wherein I was able to approach any of the counsellors within the team to get insights into various sectors of interest.\nThe office also worked with other experts to equip participants with critical skills – my favourite was one where I learnt how to tell a better story about myself!\nOverall, the Careers team has impressed me with their future-oriented mindset and genuine passion in helping participants. I would recommend any participant interested in improving his or her employability to have a chat with their career counsellor soon!\nDaniel Rivera\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nI did my research prior to taking up my MBA programme. Institutional reputation, extent of alumni network and support of the career office were important considerations for me. For these reasons, I chose the Nanyang MBA. I am glad I did – to this day, I still ask the Career Office for advice on career because I trust them!\nWhen I started the Nanyang MBA, I did not know anyone in Singapore and had no idea how to go about searching for jobs in this country. Raised in Korea and having only worked in Europe, I benefitted immensely from the guidance given by the Career Office in a variety of areas, such as how to introduce myself over LinkedIn, how to get the most out of networking sessions, and how to pitch myself to prospective employers.\nThe Career Office also gave me the opportunity to meet with alumni and their stories of overcoming challenges, similar to what I faced, were very reassuring for me. My confidence in the Career Office was further strengthened when company recruiters attested to the level of effort put in by the Career Office in helping every participant get noticed by hiring managers. The team indeed showed true passion and they are the biggest asset from my NBS days!\nElla Choi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2018\nAPAC IT Data Project Manager, L’Oréal\nThe support provided by the Career Office was immensely helpful throughout my NBS journey. The Career Office lined up a series of workshops to get our resumes ready and equip us with essential interview skills even before we stepped into our first class. Throughout the semesters, the Career Office would also invite guest speakers from various companies to share experiences and provide valuable insights to help us make better and more informed career choices.\nWhat really helped was how the Career Office kept an eye out for opportunities for every participant, whether in the form of internships or full-time roles. This personalised approach was what helped me land my current role.\nThe Career Office was a key supporter through my journey with NBS, and I am glad that I made full use of the open-door policy of the team to get career coaching and counselling. These sessions were definitely more useful than I had initially thought!\nNigel Ng\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2020\nAnalyst, RV Capital\nMy Nanyang Professional MBA journey was truly enriching and fruitful. I received tremendous support in one-to-one coaching and in accessing career opportunities.  I also attended networking sessions and was notified of different job openings and recruitment sessions by renowned companies in various sectors.\nThanks to the Career Office, I successfully secured an interesting job, working directly with high-level stakeholders from around the region.

There were also networking sessions that provided avenues for me to connect with alumni and industry experts.\nKimberly Liew Bei Xin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nAs a sponsored participant with my career locked in for the next few years, I was initially sceptical about how the Career Office could add value to my learning journey with NBS. However, my scepticism was debunked during orientation, when I understood how the Career Office partnered each participant through a structured career journey during our time with NBS and beyond.\nFrom resume building and profiling activities to customised workshops in topics ranging from personal branding to sharing developments within specific industries and sectors, I saw how the Career Office worked to cater to the diverse needs and interests of every participant.\nI took part in some of these workshops and picked up skills which I believe would remain relevant to me throughout my career. What I have also found beneficial was the one-to-one career coaching sessions, from which I not only gained clarity over my career purpose, but also gleaned valuable insights about areas to work on for my personal growth.\nAnthony Chor Xingyou\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nThe Career Office works with participants one-on-one to provide tailored career services through skill workshops, networking sessions, career coaching, and many more. The team also provides many exclusive resources for both full-time and part-time job opportunities.\nI personally found my internship through the Career Office’s network and support, including resume workshops, company visits, and personal coaching sessions. With the strong support, I can rest assured that the Nanyang MBA program will help me elevate my career to the next level.\nChris Lin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nI first learnt about the Career Office during orientation. Since then, I have interacted closely with the team in the office and gained guidance in fine-tuning my resume and understanding potential roles for me to explore.\nThe office also organised networking events and seminars which were helpful in getting me career ready. My favourite has been the personal branding workshop, which helped me better communicate and present who I am.\nA key highlight was also the personal career coach who worked with me to leverage my transferable skills and move into my ideal roles. The Career Office is indeed one’s best friend during this NBS journey, helping set NBS apart from other global MBA programmes.\nLorybeth Rugay Baldrias-Serrano\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nI deeply appreciate the support of the NBS Career Office in guiding me along the job search process.  My career counsellor helped alleviate the apprehension I felt about job interviews. Feedback during mock interviews and from video sessions helped me gain a lot of self-awareness, and I am now more confident of myself during interviews.\nThe Career Office has also been fabulous in tapping into the rich pool of alumni, which NBS has. Through alumni engagement sessions, I had the chance to hear the experience of those now working in companies such as Microsoft, Twitter, Goggle, and P&G. The experience and perspectives shared by these alumni have given me a clearer understanding of my career prospects, and I am deeply grateful to the Career Office for this.\nZhu Siyi\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nReturning to school for a postgraduate degree was a big decision, so I was hoping that the choice of NBS would make sense from both the academic and career angles. I have to say that the Career Office did not disappoint. The activities planned by the Office were well thought through and synced with the recruitment cycles of hiring companies.\nI have benefitted immensely from the help of my career counsellor who gave me career guidance and helped review my resume. The career counsellor simplified the world of internship for me and linked me to available internship opportunities. Knowing that the Career Office is ever ready to support me in my journey is a fantastic feeling and a big assurance to my life in NBS!\nZhang Yuejiao\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2021\nThe decision to leave a full-time job to pursue further studies during a global pandemic was certainly a major decision in my life. My choice of university was very much influenced by what its career office could offer, as I had positive experience with my career office during my undergraduate days in India. I was convinced that NTU was the right choice for me when I attended a programme briefing and the NBS Career Office gave useful information on the support level offered to participants of the programme.\nHaving embarked on the programme with NBS, I must say that the Career Office was everything I expected it to be, and more. The career counsellors in the Office were helpful and encouraging, and organised numerous talks to help participants understand our career options within different functions. Networking sessions with alumni and corporate partners widened our network for job opportunities.\nThe Career Office was also constantly sourcing for internships, and it was through one of these that I got my role with Johnson Controls Innovation Center. The support and guidance from the team has also helped me sharpen my career goals too. I am sure the invaluable support from the Office will continue into the future.\nVivek Goyal\nMSc Business Analytics Class of 2021\nComing from a university in the UK, I had assumed that career offices across all universities would offer similar services. I can now say with confidence that not all offices are the same – the proactive stance of the NBS Career Office sets it apart from the rest.\nApart from \"standard\" services like resume reviews and provision of a jobs portal, the approachable team in the NBS Career Office works to improve employability of every participant. From the start of my term, I worked with my career counsellor on a career development plan.\nWhat I also liked was the open-door policy of the Career Office, wherein I was able to approach any of the counsellors within the team to get insights into various sectors of interest.\nThe office also worked with other experts to equip participants with critical skills – my favourite was one where I learnt how to tell a better story about myself!\nOverall, the Careers team has impressed me with their future-oriented mindset and genuine passion in helping participants. I would recommend any participant interested in improving his or her employability to have a chat with their career counsellor soon!\nDaniel Rivera\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nI did my research prior to taking up my MBA programme. Institutional reputation, extent of alumni network and support of the career office were important considerations for me. For these reasons, I chose the Nanyang MBA. I am glad I did – to this day, I still ask the Career Office for advice on career because I trust them!\nWhen I started the Nanyang MBA, I did not know anyone in Singapore and had no idea how to go about searching for jobs in this country. Raised in Korea and having only worked in Europe, I benefitted immensely from the guidance given by the Career Office in a variety of areas, such as how to introduce myself over LinkedIn, how to get the most out of networking sessions, and how to pitch myself to prospective employers.\nThe Career Office also gave me the opportunity to meet with alumni and their stories of overcoming challenges, similar to what I faced, were very reassuring for me. My confidence in the Career Office was further strengthened when company recruiters attested to the level of effort put in by the Career Office in helping every participant get noticed by hiring managers. The team indeed showed true passion and they are the biggest asset from my NBS days!\nElla Choi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2018\nAPAC IT Data Project Manager, L’Oréal\nThe support provided by the Career Office was immensely helpful throughout my NBS journey. The Career Office lined up a series of workshops to get our resumes ready and equip us with essential interview skills even before we stepped into our first class. Throughout the semesters, the Career Office would also invite guest speakers from various companies to share experiences and provide valuable insights to help us make better and more informed career choices.\nWhat really helped was how the Career Office kept an eye out for opportunities for every participant, whether in the form of internships or full-time roles. This personalised approach was what helped me land my current role.\nThe Career Office was a key supporter through my journey with NBS, and I am glad that I made full use of the open-door policy of the team to get career coaching and counselling. These sessions were definitely more useful than I had initially thought!\nNigel Ng\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2020\nAnalyst, RV Capital\nMy Nanyang Professional MBA journey was truly enriching and fruitful. I received tremendous support in one-to-one coaching and in accessing career opportunities.  I also attended networking sessions and was notified of different job openings and recruitment sessions by renowned companies in various sectors.\nThanks to the Career Office, I successfully secured an interesting job, working directly with high-level stakeholders from around the region. It was through the Career Office that I got the opportunity to interview for this new role, in an industry which I had no prior professional experience in.\nIt was indeed a rare opportunity made possible by the Nanyang Professional MBA and the Career Office, for which I am extremely grateful.\nCheryl Chong\nNanyang Professional MBA Class of 2020\nBusiness Analyst, South Asia Country Group Management & Asia Sales and Client Management, Willis Towers Watson\nGraduating during the COVID-19 pandemic was unnerving, but the support of the Career Office made all the difference.\nFrom the start of the programme, I was given the opportunity to network with alumni and gained valuable insights into different industries and interview processes of several companies.  I also had a career coach who helped me uncover my true passion and worked with me to brand myself around who I truly am.\nWorking with the Career Office as a partner certainly helped me get the most out of my Nanyang MBA with NBS.\nLam Hao Zhi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2020\nManagement Associate, Dole Food Company\nDeloitte’s partnership with the Nanyang Business School (NBS) is a longstanding one.

        "title": "FAQs",
        "content": "General Programme Questions\nThe MSc Financial Engineering programme at Nanyang Business School is offered under the auspices of a business school with the combined expertise the Nanyang Business School (NBS) and the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS) in NTU. As a result, NTU MFE students learn about financial engineering within the context of business and economic principles, benefit from the expertise of faculty from the Business school as well as SPMS, and enjoy the additional advantages of the business school's career services, corporate contacts, and orientation towards business applications.\nThe MSc Financial Engineering programme also includes an optional seven-week term at Carnegie Mellon University, USA, bringing financial practices in the east and west live to the classrooms. Upon successful completion of the 7-week term, students will be awarded a Certificate in Computational Finance from CMU.\nMBA:  There are many differences between an MFE and MBA. Some of them are obvious, for example the MFE programme can be completed in one year (full-time study), while an MBA typically takes two years. The MFE is a graduate degree in a highly specialized type of Finance, and an MBA is a more general, well-rounded business degree, offering courses in areas such as Marketing, HR/Management, Strategy, Accounting, and Finance.\nMost MBA programmes do not require the high-level of math, analytic ability, or computer programming experience required by the MFE programme. The combination of skills obtained by MFE graduates (understanding of complex financial strategies, financial modelling ability and computational proficiency) are difficult for employers to find in graduates of general MBA or Engineering programmes.\nOther MSc Finance related programmes such as Applied Finance, Wealth Management etc.: Like the MBA programme, these programmes do not offer the combination of skills obtained by MFE graduates. These programmes have less emphasis on math and programming skills and do not offer a combination of finance, mathematics and computing.\nCFA (Chartered Financial Analyst): The main difference is that a CFA is an independent certification process, not an academic distinction. Also, unlike the MFE programme, the CFA has little emphasis on math and programming skills to solve financial problems. Many people in the Finance Industry get their CFA in addition to advanced degrees in Finance. For some jobs it is desirable to have both, but they are not interchangeable by definition.\nAdmissions\nThe MSc Financial Engineering programme at Nanyang Business School looks for candidates with a background in applied mathematics, applied science, statistics, computer science, engineering, economics, or other similar quantitative fields. Applicants from other disciplines with strong academic performance may also be considered. We are looking for individuals for whom the programme is a good \"career-fit\", and who are likely to have successful future careers. Above all, you will need to demonstrate that you have the commitment, experience, motivation, and potential to benefit from, and contribute to, the programme.\nIndividuals who hold a good undergraduate degree can apply for admission to the programme. GRE or GMAT is a compulsory requirement for admission to this programme. Work experience is preferred but not mandatory. Please click\nhere\nfor details on admission requirements.\nUnder rolling admissions, applications are reviewed as they are received, rather than after a fixed deadline. This means that the earlier you apply, the sooner your application will be reviewed and you may receive an admission decision. Early application improves your chances of being shortlisted sooner and increases the likelihood of securing a place in the programme and being considered for scholarships.\nThough there is no specific degree requirement, most students will have undergraduate or graduate degrees in applied science, statistics, mathematics, engineering, computer science or other similar quantitative fields. Applicants from other disciplines will also be considered. The common requirement for all students in the programme is that they enter it with a high level of intellectual curiosity and a strong interest in finance.\nThe MFE programme is highly quantitative. While the math background of our students varies, most have taken engineering-level math courses beyond Calculus such as Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. If you have not done much math during your undergraduate study, you should be able to demonstrate your mathematical ability through other ways such as GMAT/GRE, good GCE ‘A’ Level (or high school equivalent) math, or work experience.\nGMAT or GRE is required and a good GMAT or GRE score would enhance your application. The GMAT or GRE score provides us with another platform to evaluate your application especially if academic results, work experience, etc are not comparable with other\napplicants. Please note that a low GMAT or GRE score will not exclude your application from being considered. There is no minimum cut-off score for GMAT or GRE. Either the GMAT or GRE is accepted. Original copies of the test scores are required.

There were also networking sessions that provided avenues for me to connect with alumni and industry experts.\nKimberly Liew Bei Xin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nAs a sponsored participant with my career locked in for the next few years, I was initially sceptical about how the Career Office could add value to my learning journey with NBS. However, my scepticism was debunked during orientation, when I understood how the Career Office partnered each participant through a structured career journey during our time with NBS and beyond.\nFrom resume building and profiling activities to customised workshops in topics ranging from personal branding to sharing developments within specific industries and sectors, I saw how the Career Office worked to cater to the diverse needs and interests of every participant.\nI took part in some of these workshops and picked up skills which I believe would remain relevant to me throughout my career. What I have also found beneficial was the one-to-one career coaching sessions, from which I not only gained clarity over my career purpose, but also gleaned valuable insights about areas to work on for my personal growth.\nAnthony Chor Xingyou\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nThe Career Office works with participants one-on-one to provide tailored career services through skill workshops, networking sessions, career coaching, and many more. The team also provides many exclusive resources for both full-time and part-time job opportunities.\nI personally found my internship through the Career Office’s network and support, including resume workshops, company visits, and personal coaching sessions. With the strong support, I can rest assured that the Nanyang MBA program will help me elevate my career to the next level.\nChris Lin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nI first learnt about the Career Office during orientation. Since then, I have interacted closely with the team in the office and gained guidance in fine-tuning my resume and understanding potential roles for me to explore.\nThe office also organised networking events and seminars which were helpful in getting me career ready. My favourite has been the personal branding workshop, which helped me better communicate and present who I am.\nA key highlight was also the personal career coach who worked with me to leverage my transferable skills and move into my ideal roles. The Career Office is indeed one’s best friend during this NBS journey, helping set NBS apart from other global MBA programmes.\nLorybeth Rugay Baldrias-Serrano\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nI deeply appreciate the support of the NBS Career Office in guiding me along the job search process.  My career counsellor helped alleviate the apprehension I felt about job interviews. Feedback during mock interviews and from video sessions helped me gain a lot of self-awareness, and I am now more confident of myself during interviews.\nThe Career Office has also been fabulous in tapping into the rich pool of alumni, which NBS has. Through alumni engagement sessions, I had the chance to hear the experience of those now working in companies such as Microsoft, Twitter, Goggle, and P&G. The experience and perspectives shared by these alumni have given me a clearer understanding of my career prospects, and I am deeply grateful to the Career Office for this.\nZhu Siyi\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nReturning to school for a postgraduate degree was a big decision, so I was hoping that the choice of NBS would make sense from both the academic and career angles. I have to say that the Career Office did not disappoint. The activities planned by the Office were well thought through and synced with the recruitment cycles of hiring companies.\nI have benefitted immensely from the help of my career counsellor who gave me career guidance and helped review my resume. The career counsellor simplified the world of internship for me and linked me to available internship opportunities. Knowing that the Career Office is ever ready to support me in my journey is a fantastic feeling and a big assurance to my life in NBS!\nZhang Yuejiao\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2021\nThe decision to leave a full-time job to pursue further studies during a global pandemic was certainly a major decision in my life. My choice of university was very much influenced by what its career office could offer, as I had positive experience with my career office during my undergraduate days in India. I was convinced that NTU was the right choice for me when I attended a programme briefing and the NBS Career Office gave useful information on the support level offered to participants of the programme.\nHaving embarked on the programme with NBS, I must say that the Career Office was everything I expected it to be, and more. The career counsellors in the Office were helpful and encouraging, and organised numerous talks to help participants understand our career options within different functions. Networking sessions with alumni and corporate partners widened our network for job opportunities.\nThe Career Office was also constantly sourcing for internships, and it was through one of these that I got my role with Johnson Controls Innovation Center. The support and guidance from the team has also helped me sharpen my career goals too. I am sure the invaluable support from the Office will continue into the future.\nVivek Goyal\nMSc Business Analytics Class of 2021\nComing from a university in the UK, I had assumed that career offices across all universities would offer similar services. I can now say with confidence that not all offices are the same – the proactive stance of the NBS Career Office sets it apart from the rest.\nApart from \"standard\" services like resume reviews and provision of a jobs portal, the approachable team in the NBS Career Office works to improve employability of every participant. From the start of my term, I worked with my career counsellor on a career development plan.\nWhat I also liked was the open-door policy of the Career Office, wherein I was able to approach any of the counsellors within the team to get insights into various sectors of interest.\nThe office also worked with other experts to equip participants with critical skills – my favourite was one where I learnt how to tell a better story about myself!\nOverall, the Careers team has impressed me with their future-oriented mindset and genuine passion in helping participants. I would recommend any participant interested in improving his or her employability to have a chat with their career counsellor soon!\nDaniel Rivera\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nI did my research prior to taking up my MBA programme. Institutional reputation, extent of alumni network and support of the career office were important considerations for me. For these reasons, I chose the Nanyang MBA. I am glad I did – to this day, I still ask the Career Office for advice on career because I trust them!\nWhen I started the Nanyang MBA, I did not know anyone in Singapore and had no idea how to go about searching for jobs in this country. Raised in Korea and having only worked in Europe, I benefitted immensely from the guidance given by the Career Office in a variety of areas, such as how to introduce myself over LinkedIn, how to get the most out of networking sessions, and how to pitch myself to prospective employers.\nThe Career Office also gave me the opportunity to meet with alumni and their stories of overcoming challenges, similar to what I faced, were very reassuring for me. My confidence in the Career Office was further strengthened when company recruiters attested to the level of effort put in by the Career Office in helping every participant get noticed by hiring managers. The team indeed showed true passion and they are the biggest asset from my NBS days!\nElla Choi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2018\nAPAC IT Data Project Manager, L’Oréal\nThe support provided by the Career Office was immensely helpful throughout my NBS journey. The Career Office lined up a series of workshops to get our resumes ready and equip us with essential interview skills even before we stepped into our first class. Throughout the semesters, the Career Office would also invite guest speakers from various companies to share experiences and provide valuable insights to help us make better and more informed career choices.\nWhat really helped was how the Career Office kept an eye out for opportunities for every participant, whether in the form of internships or full-time roles. This personalised approach was what helped me land my current role.\nThe Career Office was a key supporter through my journey with NBS, and I am glad that I made full use of the open-door policy of the team to get career coaching and counselling. These sessions were definitely more useful than I had initially thought!\nNigel Ng\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2020\nAnalyst, RV Capital\nMy Nanyang Professional MBA journey was truly enriching and fruitful. I received tremendous support in one-to-one coaching and in accessing career opportunities.  I also attended networking sessions and was notified of different job openings and recruitment sessions by renowned companies in various sectors.\nThanks to the Career Office, I successfully secured an interesting job, working directly with high-level stakeholders from around the region. It was through the Career Office that I got the opportunity to interview for this new role, in an industry which I had no prior professional experience in.\nIt was indeed a rare opportunity made possible by the Nanyang Professional MBA and the Career Office, for which I am extremely grateful.\nCheryl Chong\nNanyang Professional MBA Class of 2020\nBusiness Analyst, South Asia Country Group Management & Asia Sales and Client Management, Willis Towers Watson\nGraduating during the COVID-19 pandemic was unnerving, but the support of the Career Office made all the difference.\nFrom the start of the programme, I was given the opportunity to network with alumni and gained valuable insights into different industries and interview processes of several companies.  I also had a career coach who helped me uncover my true passion and worked with me to brand myself around who I truly am.\nWorking with the Career Office as a partner certainly helped me get the most out of my Nanyang MBA with NBS.\nLam Hao Zhi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2020\nManagement Associate, Dole Food Company\nDeloitte’s partnership with the Nanyang Business School (NBS) is a longstanding one. Graduates of NBS are well positioned to be the next generation of leaders, and we have had great success hiring NBS graduates for positions across our organisation. In the course of their work, they exhibit drive, professionalism and the willingness to learn – attributes that are essential in today’s dynamic workplace. We look forward to a continued relationship with NBS and help their graduates make an impact that matters in their roles at Deloitte.\nSeah Gek Choo\nDeloitte Singapore\nNTU and NBS have always been one of the most important university partners for JD.com in Singapore. Thanks to the dedication and support from the career services team at NBS, over the past years JD.com has organised many successful campus engagement events such as the NTU campus recruitment talk/interview day and the virtual JD open day, which attracted many NTU graduates who have become key talents at JD.com. We look forward to deepening our collaboration with NTU and NBS, and always welcome future NTU talent to the JD.com family.\nHan Huixian\nCampus Recruitment Manager, JD.com\nThe team in the Career Office has been highly proactive in maintaining connections with me.  I have been offered various opportunities to interact with and contribute back to the business school.

        "content": "As a graduate of the MSc in Marketing Science programme at Nanyang Business School, you will be equipped with the strategic, analytical, and technical skills needed to successfully lead marketing campaigns and drive company growth in the martech world.\nOur one-year, full-time Master’s programme encompasses:​\n​Core Modules | Consumer Insights Modules | Techno​logy Modules\n​Strategic MarketingBranding​B2B MarketingMarketing AnalyticsMarketing ResearchMarketing SustainabilityFinance for Marketing Decisions | Integrated Marketing CommunicationsConsumer PsychologyEthnography in Practice | Digital MarketingConsumer Neuroscience & NeuromarketingMarketing In The Tech Era\n*Please note that the module descriptions may be subject to change.\nThis is a core course on marketing at the strategic level. It is intended for expe​rienced marketing professionals who already have proficient knowledge of marketing but need higher-level insights to prepare themselves for management roles that require\nenlightened perspectives on the strategic functions of marketing.\nAlthough most of the issues discussed in this course are viewed from the perspective of a senior marketing executive (e.g., a Vice President of Marketing or a Director of Marketing), the course is also relevant to those intending to pursue careers\nin related functions, including general management, corporate planning, business development, R&D/innovation, sales/key account management, and even finance.\nAs a participant, you will get to address critical decision issues involved in strategic marketing planning, including segmentation and positioning, product development, new market entry, coordination of marketing mix actions, and management of the marketing\nbudget.\nIn order to prepare you for the above challenges which can arise very soon in your career, this course provides an experiential learning environment in which you will gain not only an appreciation but also a personal feel for the tasks of strategic marketing\nplanning and decision making.\nYou will learn to become an effective marketing decision maker, one who is capable of minimising (though not completely removing) much of the uncertainties surrounding marketing decisions through disciplined analysis and prudent judgement.\nThis course also requires you to manage a hypothetical marketing budget. You will therefore learn to behave like a responsible marketer, exercising fiscal discipline and properly justifying all marketing expenditures using sound commercial reasoning.\nBrands are increasingly important. A brand that connects with consumers can differentiate a company and its products from its competitors. This course covers branding from the perspectives of consumers and marketers. The course examines how consumers  react to branding strategies, and how a brand can build a strong presence in the market.\nThis course will introduce you to key consumer behaviour concepts, equipping you – as a current or future manager – with the knowledge to evaluate and design effective marketing decisions.\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to understand:\nThe psychology of how consumers think, feel, reason, and choose between different alternatives (e.g., brands, products)\nThe influence of social and cultural environments (e.g., friends, family, and culture) on consumer behaviour\nHow marketers can adapt and improve their marketing campaigns/strategies to more effectively reach and influence the consumers.\nYou will also learn to appreciate the relevance of consumer behaviour for marketers and policymakers.\nIn the marketplace, firms need to address marketing problems and make marketing decisions quickly. Information collection and information analysis should serve as the key base for solving those problems and making those decisions. Hence, it is important\nfor you to learn the tools, skills, and methods to collect and analyse relevant data.\nThe modern organisation has scores of data (e.g., web retail traffic data) that are often under-utilised for business planning and market research opportunities. This course equips you with the knowledge and skills to investigate existing business operational\ndata to continually develop innovative marketing insights and new solutions for marketing decisions.\nYou will be exposed to various data modelling techniques using real-life business data that will allow you to provide useful predictions such as supply and demand forecast, pricing and profitability forecast, consumer trend analysis, and the likes.\nThis course systematically introduces the process of developing a strong business analytic case starting from the exploration of the data context to finally obtaining the explanatory or predictive results.\nIt is important for non-financial professionals to be able to interpret and analyse the myriad of financial information to contribute effectively to their organisations. This course has been developed to integrate financial concepts into a broader decision-making framework, and specifically to show how financial information is tied to the strategic context of organisations. Emphasis is placed on how non-financial professionals should effectively include financial considerations in their respective functional roles and how to harness critical financial information for their tactical planning and strategic business decisions.​\nDigital marketing will dominate the way companies communicate with and sell to consumers (and other businesses). This course covers the principles and practices of digital marketing and how digital channels are used to build brands in conjunction with an effective content marketing strategy.\nThis course examines how digital marketing can build or break influence, be used as a research and customer service tool. It will give you the tools and strategies to design and evaluate digital marketing campaigns for brands, explore changing customer needs, and gain consumer insights.\nThis course focuses on B2B marketing – the strategic decision of what value to provide, how to provide it, and how to do so profitably. Students will understand that marketing is a B2B discipline integrally related to accounting, finance, operations, human resources, and statistics. This course will help students differentiate customer-based strategy from Sales, Business Development, and Selling.\nThis course delves deep into the intersection of innovative technologies and contemporary marketing strategies, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the transformative role of technologies in reshaping the marketing landscape.\nYou will assess how AR/VR facilitates experiential marketing, venture into the evolving metaverse for consumer engagement, understand the revolutionary shift brought by AI in predictive marketing, examine how the expansive IoT forms a connected ecosystem, and explore the role of blockchain in promoting consumer trust.\nThe emerging roles of autonomous vehicles and robotics in the marketing ecosystem will also be evaluated. Moreover, in the backdrop of these tech-driven innovations, ethical considerations inherent in tech-driven marketing will be discussed.\nThis course aims to equip you with the knowledge to integrate new technologies into strategic marketing initiatives and campaigns.\nIntegrated marketing Communications (or ‘IMC’) has been a popular ‘buzz phrase’ since the fragmentation of marketing communications budgets and the proliferation of communication channels.\nIMC essentially looks at different ways for companies to communicate about their brand, in an integrated fashion. Yet IMC is much misunderstood and is rarely successfully implemented. The core of IMC is that everything a company does, and sometimes what\nit does not do, can send a powerful brand message.\nThe emphasis of this course will be on understanding target customer motivations and persuasion, crafting effective and creative messages, making efficient use of media, and understanding metrics. By the end of this course, you should not only be familiar\nwith a large body of advertising knowledge, but should also be able to apply this information to create effective advertising strategies and tactics.\nEthnography has been widely adopted by marketers, service teams, and product designers to help develop a rich, holistic, and nuanced view of consumers and users.\nThis course helps you understand what and how ethnography is used to deal with today’s marketing challenges in the real and online marketplace. The focus of the course will be to:\nIntroduce you to the motivation, rationale, and power of the ethnography method\nEquip you with the necessary skills to\nconceptualise and design ethnographic projects for real and online spaces\napply ethnographic tools and techniques\norganise, analyse, and interpret ethnographic data.\nThis course introduces the fields of neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience. It is vital for anyone who wants to understand consumers or customers at a deep, emotional level and to be able to craft marketing messages to consumers with greater precision.​\nBy studying consumers’ subconscious responses to brands, products, and marketing materials, you will be able to more accurately predict purchasing behaviour than using traditional market research methods alone.\nFor example, regular focus groups and surveys are usually confounded by the fact that people don’t always tell the truth about what they think or they don’t always know how they feel. As a result, neuromarketing is now widely used by multinational\ncompanies to develop superior products that will also succeed in a global marketplace.\nThe course will delve into the range of new neuromarketing techniques that are now available. For example, you will get to examine the pros and cons of:\nUsing eye-tracking devices to monitor people viewing websites to see what they are looking at, and where they are looking\nMonitoring consumers’ brain activity as they view adverts or new products to measure their emotions)\nIn addition, case studies will be used to demonstrate how the different approaches are being used by companies to tackle a very wide range of marketing questions.\nYou will also learn how insights from the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience can be applied in order to make marketing messages and communications more attention grabbing, more memorable, and emotionally engaging.\nAlso covered will be emerging research showing how digital technology is re-wiring the human brain and changing our behaviour in subtle ways, ways that you will need to understand in order to create more effective campaigns and messaging in today’s\ndigital environment.\nIn today's dynamic market landscape, achieving market leadership hinges on sustainability—a holistic concept embracing environmental preservation and social responsibility. Embracing the triple bottom line—people, planet, and profit—positions businesses to not only fortify their competitive edge but also generate enhanced shareholder value. Throughout this course, you'll delve into the macro-industry forces shaping our current context, recognize businesses' pivotal role in sustainability management, and grasp that sustainability constitutes a fundamental marketing challenge. You'll gain practical skills and strategic frameworks to effectively promote sustainability to a diverse array of stakeholders, both internal (such as management and employees) and external (including consumers, customers, and suppliers). This course is indispensable for aspiring entrepreneurs, managers, or advocates aiming to champion sustainable initiatives and drive transformative change within their organisations.\nAt Nanyang Business School, we equip our MSc Marketing Science graduates with comprehensive marketing expertise, techniques, and tools.  So they are well positioned for an exciting career in marketing, with various roles across different industries.\nHere are some key job opportunities that you can look forward to as an MSc Marketing Science graduate.\nApply Now\nSubmit your CV\nAttend our Events\nJoin our Mailing List\nDownload Brochure\nDownload Employment Highlights\nGraduate Studies Blog\nSchedule 1 to 1 Consultation\nChat with our MSc Participants\nConnect With Us at NBS!\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\nYouTube",

There were also networking sessions that provided avenues for me to connect with alumni and industry experts.\nKimberly Liew Bei Xin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nAs a sponsored participant with my career locked in for the next few years, I was initially sceptical about how the Career Office could add value to my learning journey with NBS. However, my scepticism was debunked during orientation, when I understood how the Career Office partnered each participant through a structured career journey during our time with NBS and beyond.\nFrom resume building and profiling activities to customised workshops in topics ranging from personal branding to sharing developments within specific industries and sectors, I saw how the Career Office worked to cater to the diverse needs and interests of every participant.\nI took part in some of these workshops and picked up skills which I believe would remain relevant to me throughout my career. What I have also found beneficial was the one-to-one career coaching sessions, from which I not only gained clarity over my career purpose, but also gleaned valuable insights about areas to work on for my personal growth.\nAnthony Chor Xingyou\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nThe Career Office works with participants one-on-one to provide tailored career services through skill workshops, networking sessions, career coaching, and many more. The team also provides many exclusive resources for both full-time and part-time job opportunities.\nI personally found my internship through the Career Office’s network and support, including resume workshops, company visits, and personal coaching sessions. With the strong support, I can rest assured that the Nanyang MBA program will help me elevate my career to the next level.\nChris Lin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nI first learnt about the Career Office during orientation. Since then, I have interacted closely with the team in the office and gained guidance in fine-tuning my resume and understanding potential roles for me to explore.\nThe office also organised networking events and seminars which were helpful in getting me career ready. My favourite has been the personal branding workshop, which helped me better communicate and present who I am.\nA key highlight was also the personal career coach who worked with me to leverage my transferable skills and move into my ideal roles. The Career Office is indeed one’s best friend during this NBS journey, helping set NBS apart from other global MBA programmes.\nLorybeth Rugay Baldrias-Serrano\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nI deeply appreciate the support of the NBS Career Office in guiding me along the job search process.  My career counsellor helped alleviate the apprehension I felt about job interviews. Feedback during mock interviews and from video sessions helped me gain a lot of self-awareness, and I am now more confident of myself during interviews.\nThe Career Office has also been fabulous in tapping into the rich pool of alumni, which NBS has. Through alumni engagement sessions, I had the chance to hear the experience of those now working in companies such as Microsoft, Twitter, Goggle, and P&G. The experience and perspectives shared by these alumni have given me a clearer understanding of my career prospects, and I am deeply grateful to the Career Office for this.\nZhu Siyi\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nReturning to school for a postgraduate degree was a big decision, so I was hoping that the choice of NBS would make sense from both the academic and career angles. I have to say that the Career Office did not disappoint. The activities planned by the Office were well thought through and synced with the recruitment cycles of hiring companies.\nI have benefitted immensely from the help of my career counsellor who gave me career guidance and helped review my resume. The career counsellor simplified the world of internship for me and linked me to available internship opportunities. Knowing that the Career Office is ever ready to support me in my journey is a fantastic feeling and a big assurance to my life in NBS!\nZhang Yuejiao\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2021\nThe decision to leave a full-time job to pursue further studies during a global pandemic was certainly a major decision in my life. My choice of university was very much influenced by what its career office could offer, as I had positive experience with my career office during my undergraduate days in India. I was convinced that NTU was the right choice for me when I attended a programme briefing and the NBS Career Office gave useful information on the support level offered to participants of the programme.\nHaving embarked on the programme with NBS, I must say that the Career Office was everything I expected it to be, and more. The career counsellors in the Office were helpful and encouraging, and organised numerous talks to help participants understand our career options within different functions. Networking sessions with alumni and corporate partners widened our network for job opportunities.\nThe Career Office was also constantly sourcing for internships, and it was through one of these that I got my role with Johnson Controls Innovation Center. The support and guidance from the team has also helped me sharpen my career goals too. I am sure the invaluable support from the Office will continue into the future.\nVivek Goyal\nMSc Business Analytics Class of 2021\nComing from a university in the UK, I had assumed that career offices across all universities would offer similar services. I can now say with confidence that not all offices are the same – the proactive stance of the NBS Career Office sets it apart from the rest.\nApart from \"standard\" services like resume reviews and provision of a jobs portal, the approachable team in the NBS Career Office works to improve employability of every participant. From the start of my term, I worked with my career counsellor on a career development plan.\nWhat I also liked was the open-door policy of the Career Office, wherein I was able to approach any of the counsellors within the team to get insights into various sectors of interest.\nThe office also worked with other experts to equip participants with critical skills – my favourite was one where I learnt how to tell a better story about myself!\nOverall, the Careers team has impressed me with their future-oriented mindset and genuine passion in helping participants. I would recommend any participant interested in improving his or her employability to have a chat with their career counsellor soon!\nDaniel Rivera\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nI did my research prior to taking up my MBA programme. Institutional reputation, extent of alumni network and support of the career office were important considerations for me. For these reasons, I chose the Nanyang MBA. I am glad I did – to this day, I still ask the Career Office for advice on career because I trust them!\nWhen I started the Nanyang MBA, I did not know anyone in Singapore and had no idea how to go about searching for jobs in this country. Raised in Korea and having only worked in Europe, I benefitted immensely from the guidance given by the Career Office in a variety of areas, such as how to introduce myself over LinkedIn, how to get the most out of networking sessions, and how to pitch myself to prospective employers.\nThe Career Office also gave me the opportunity to meet with alumni and their stories of overcoming challenges, similar to what I faced, were very reassuring for me. My confidence in the Career Office was further strengthened when company recruiters attested to the level of effort put in by the Career Office in helping every participant get noticed by hiring managers. The team indeed showed true passion and they are the biggest asset from my NBS days!\nElla Choi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2018\nAPAC IT Data Project Manager, L’Oréal\nThe support provided by the Career Office was immensely helpful throughout my NBS journey. The Career Office lined up a series of workshops to get our resumes ready and equip us with essential interview skills even before we stepped into our first class. Throughout the semesters, the Career Office would also invite guest speakers from various companies to share experiences and provide valuable insights to help us make better and more informed career choices.\nWhat really helped was how the Career Office kept an eye out for opportunities for every participant, whether in the form of internships or full-time roles. This personalised approach was what helped me land my current role.\nThe Career Office was a key supporter through my journey with NBS, and I am glad that I made full use of the open-door policy of the team to get career coaching and counselling. These sessions were definitely more useful than I had initially thought!\nNigel Ng\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2020\nAnalyst, RV Capital\nMy Nanyang Professional MBA journey was truly enriching and fruitful. I received tremendous support in one-to-one coaching and in accessing career opportunities.  I also attended networking sessions and was notified of different job openings and recruitment sessions by renowned companies in various sectors.\nThanks to the Career Office, I successfully secured an interesting job, working directly with high-level stakeholders from around the region. It was through the Career Office that I got the opportunity to interview for this new role, in an industry which I had no prior professional experience in.\nIt was indeed a rare opportunity made possible by the Nanyang Professional MBA and the Career Office, for which I am extremely grateful.\nCheryl Chong\nNanyang Professional MBA Class of 2020\nBusiness Analyst, South Asia Country Group Management & Asia Sales and Client Management, Willis Towers Watson\nGraduating during the COVID-19 pandemic was unnerving, but the support of the Career Office made all the difference.\nFrom the start of the programme, I was given the opportunity to network with alumni and gained valuable insights into different industries and interview processes of several companies.  I also had a career coach who helped me uncover my true passion and worked with me to brand myself around who I truly am.\nWorking with the Career Office as a partner certainly helped me get the most out of my Nanyang MBA with NBS.\nLam Hao Zhi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2020\nManagement Associate, Dole Food Company\nDeloitte’s partnership with the Nanyang Business School (NBS) is a longstanding one.
