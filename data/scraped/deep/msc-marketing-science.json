      "content": "As a graduate of the MSc in Marketing Science programme at Nanyang Business School, you will be equipped with the strategic, analytical, and technical skills needed to successfully lead marketing campaigns and drive company growth in the martech world.\nOur one-year, full-time Master’s programme encompasses:​\n​Core Modules | Consumer Insights Modules | Techno​logy Modules\n​Strategic MarketingBranding​B2B MarketingMarketing AnalyticsMarketing ResearchMarketing SustainabilityFinance for Marketing Decisions | Integrated Marketing CommunicationsConsumer PsychologyEthnography in Practice | Digital MarketingConsumer Neuroscience & NeuromarketingMarketing In The Tech Era\n*Please note that the module descriptions may be subject to change.\nThis is a core course on marketing at the strategic level. It is intended for expe​rienced marketing professionals who already have proficient knowledge of marketing but need higher-level insights to prepare themselves for management roles that require\nenlightened perspectives on the strategic functions of marketing.\nAlthough most of the issues discussed in this course are viewed from the perspective of a senior marketing executive (e.g., a Vice President of Marketing or a Director of Marketing), the course is also relevant to those intending to pursue careers\nin related functions, including general management, corporate planning, business development, R&D/innovation, sales/key account management, and even finance.\nAs a participant, you will get to address critical decision issues involved in strategic marketing planning, including segmentation and positioning, product development, new market entry, coordination of marketing mix actions, and management of the marketing\nbudget.\nIn order to prepare you for the above challenges which can arise very soon in your career, this course provides an experiential learning environment in which you will gain not only an appreciation but also a personal feel for the tasks of strategic marketing\nplanning and decision making.\nYou will learn to become an effective marketing decision maker, one who is capable of minimising (though not completely removing) much of the uncertainties surrounding marketing decisions through disciplined analysis and prudent judgement.\nThis course also requires you to manage a hypothetical marketing budget. You will therefore learn to behave like a responsible marketer, exercising fiscal discipline and properly justifying all marketing expenditures using sound commercial reasoning.\nBrands are increasingly important. A brand that connects with consumers can differentiate a company and its products from its competitors. This course covers branding from the perspectives of consumers and marketers. The course examines how consumers  react to branding strategies, and how a brand can build a strong presence in the market.\nThis course will introduce you to key consumer behaviour concepts, equipping you – as a current or future manager – with the knowledge to evaluate and design effective marketing decisions.\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to understand:\nThe psychology of how consumers think, feel, reason, and choose between different alternatives (e.g., brands, products)\nThe influence of social and cultural environments (e.g., friends, family, and culture) on consumer behaviour\nHow marketers can adapt and improve their marketing campaigns/strategies to more effectively reach and influence the consumers.\nYou will also learn to appreciate the relevance of consumer behaviour for marketers and policymakers.\nIn the marketplace, firms need to address marketing problems and make marketing decisions quickly. Information collection and information analysis should serve as the key base for solving those problems and making those decisions. Hence, it is important\nfor you to learn the tools, skills, and methods to collect and analyse relevant data.\nThe modern organisation has scores of data (e.g., web retail traffic data) that are often under-utilised for business planning and market research opportunities. This course equips you with the knowledge and skills to investigate existing business operational\ndata to continually develop innovative marketing insights and new solutions for marketing decisions.\nYou will be exposed to various data modelling techniques using real-life business data that will allow you to provide useful predictions such as supply and demand forecast, pricing and profitability forecast, consumer trend analysis, and the likes.\nThis course systematically introduces the process of developing a strong business analytic case starting from the exploration of the data context to finally obtaining the explanatory or predictive results.\nIt is important for non-financial professionals to be able to interpret and analyse the myriad of financial information to contribute effectively to their organisations. This course has been developed to integrate financial concepts into a broader decision-making framework, and specifically to show how financial information is tied to the strategic context of organisations. Emphasis is placed on how non-financial professionals should effectively include financial considerations in their respective functional roles and how to harness critical financial information for their tactical planning and strategic business decisions.​\nDigital marketing will dominate the way companies communicate with and sell to consumers (and other businesses). This course covers the principles and practices of digital marketing and how digital channels are used to build brands in conjunction with an effective content marketing strategy.\nThis course examines how digital marketing can build or break influence, be used as a research and customer service tool. It will give you the tools and strategies to design and evaluate digital marketing campaigns for brands, explore changing customer needs, and gain consumer insights.\nThis course focuses on B2B marketing – the strategic decision of what value to provide, how to provide it, and how to do so profitably. Students will understand that marketing is a B2B discipline integrally related to accounting, finance, operations, human resources, and statistics. This course will help students differentiate customer-based strategy from Sales, Business Development, and Selling.\nThis course delves deep into the intersection of innovative technologies and contemporary marketing strategies, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the transformative role of technologies in reshaping the marketing landscape.\nYou will assess how AR/VR facilitates experiential marketing, venture into the evolving metaverse for consumer engagement, understand the revolutionary shift brought by AI in predictive marketing, examine how the expansive IoT forms a connected ecosystem, and explore the role of blockchain in promoting consumer trust.\nThe emerging roles of autonomous vehicles and robotics in the marketing ecosystem will also be evaluated. Moreover, in the backdrop of these tech-driven innovations, ethical considerations inherent in tech-driven marketing will be discussed.\nThis course aims to equip you with the knowledge to integrate new technologies into strategic marketing initiatives and campaigns.\nIntegrated marketing Communications (or ‘IMC’) has been a popular ‘buzz phrase’ since the fragmentation of marketing communications budgets and the proliferation of communication channels.\nIMC essentially looks at different ways for companies to communicate about their brand, in an integrated fashion. Yet IMC is much misunderstood and is rarely successfully implemented. The core of IMC is that everything a company does, and sometimes what\nit does not do, can send a powerful brand message.\nThe emphasis of this course will be on understanding target customer motivations and persuasion, crafting effective and creative messages, making efficient use of media, and understanding metrics. By the end of this course, you should not only be familiar\nwith a large body of advertising knowledge, but should also be able to apply this information to create effective advertising strategies and tactics.\nEthnography has been widely adopted by marketers, service teams, and product designers to help develop a rich, holistic, and nuanced view of consumers and users.\nThis course helps you understand what and how ethnography is used to deal with today’s marketing challenges in the real and online marketplace. The focus of the course will be to:\nIntroduce you to the motivation, rationale, and power of the ethnography method\nEquip you with the necessary skills to\nconceptualise and design ethnographic projects for real and online spaces\napply ethnographic tools and techniques\norganise, analyse, and interpret ethnographic data.\nThis course introduces the fields of neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience. It is vital for anyone who wants to understand consumers or customers at a deep, emotional level and to be able to craft marketing messages to consumers with greater precision.​\nBy studying consumers’ subconscious responses to brands, products, and marketing materials, you will be able to more accurately predict purchasing behaviour than using traditional market research methods alone.\nFor example, regular focus groups and surveys are usually confounded by the fact that people don’t always tell the truth about what they think or they don’t always know how they feel. As a result, neuromarketing is now widely used by multinational\ncompanies to develop superior products that will also succeed in a global marketplace.\nThe course will delve into the range of new neuromarketing techniques that are now available. For example, you will get to examine the pros and cons of:\nUsing eye-tracking devices to monitor people viewing websites to see what they are looking at, and where they are looking\nMonitoring consumers’ brain activity as they view adverts or new products to measure their emotions)\nIn addition, case studies will be used to demonstrate how the different approaches are being used by companies to tackle a very wide range of marketing questions.\nYou will also learn how insights from the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience can be applied in order to make marketing messages and communications more attention grabbing, more memorable, and emotionally engaging.\nAlso covered will be emerging research showing how digital technology is re-wiring the human brain and changing our behaviour in subtle ways, ways that you will need to understand in order to create more effective campaigns and messaging in today’s\ndigital environment.\nIn today's dynamic market landscape, achieving market leadership hinges on sustainability—a holistic concept embracing environmental preservation and social responsibility. Embracing the triple bottom line—people, planet, and profit—positions businesses to not only fortify their competitive edge but also generate enhanced shareholder value. Throughout this course, you'll delve into the macro-industry forces shaping our current context, recognize businesses' pivotal role in sustainability management, and grasp that sustainability constitutes a fundamental marketing challenge. You'll gain practical skills and strategic frameworks to effectively promote sustainability to a diverse array of stakeholders, both internal (such as management and employees) and external (including consumers, customers, and suppliers). This course is indispensable for aspiring entrepreneurs, managers, or advocates aiming to champion sustainable initiatives and drive transformative change within their organisations.\nAt Nanyang Business School, we equip our MSc Marketing Science graduates with comprehensive marketing expertise, techniques, and tools.  So they are well positioned for an exciting career in marketing, with various roles across different industries.\nHere are some key job opportunities that you can look forward to as an MSc Marketing Science graduate.\nApply Now\nSubmit your CV\nAttend our Events\nJoin our Mailing List\nDownload Brochure\nDownload Employment Highlights\nGraduate Studies Blog\nSchedule 1 to 1 Consultation\nChat with our MSc Participants\nConnect With Us at NBS!\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\nYouTube",

There were also networking sessions that provided avenues for me to connect with alumni and industry experts.\nKimberly Liew Bei Xin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nAs a sponsored participant with my career locked in for the next few years, I was initially sceptical about how the Career Office could add value to my learning journey with NBS. However, my scepticism was debunked during orientation, when I understood how the Career Office partnered each participant through a structured career journey during our time with NBS and beyond.\nFrom resume building and profiling activities to customised workshops in topics ranging from personal branding to sharing developments within specific industries and sectors, I saw how the Career Office worked to cater to the diverse needs and interests of every participant.\nI took part in some of these workshops and picked up skills which I believe would remain relevant to me throughout my career. What I have also found beneficial was the one-to-one career coaching sessions, from which I not only gained clarity over my career purpose, but also gleaned valuable insights about areas to work on for my personal growth.\nAnthony Chor Xingyou\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nThe Career Office works with participants one-on-one to provide tailored career services through skill workshops, networking sessions, career coaching, and many more. The team also provides many exclusive resources for both full-time and part-time job opportunities.\nI personally found my internship through the Career Office’s network and support, including resume workshops, company visits, and personal coaching sessions. With the strong support, I can rest assured that the Nanyang MBA program will help me elevate my career to the next level.\nChris Lin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nI first learnt about the Career Office during orientation. Since then, I have interacted closely with the team in the office and gained guidance in fine-tuning my resume and understanding potential roles for me to explore.\nThe office also organised networking events and seminars which were helpful in getting me career ready. My favourite has been the personal branding workshop, which helped me better communicate and present who I am.\nA key highlight was also the personal career coach who worked with me to leverage my transferable skills and move into my ideal roles. The Career Office is indeed one’s best friend during this NBS journey, helping set NBS apart from other global MBA programmes.\nLorybeth Rugay Baldrias-Serrano\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nI deeply appreciate the support of the NBS Career Office in guiding me along the job search process.  My career counsellor helped alleviate the apprehension I felt about job interviews. Feedback during mock interviews and from video sessions helped me gain a lot of self-awareness, and I am now more confident of myself during interviews.\nThe Career Office has also been fabulous in tapping into the rich pool of alumni, which NBS has. Through alumni engagement sessions, I had the chance to hear the experience of those now working in companies such as Microsoft, Twitter, Goggle, and P&G. The experience and perspectives shared by these alumni have given me a clearer understanding of my career prospects, and I am deeply grateful to the Career Office for this.\nZhu Siyi\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nReturning to school for a postgraduate degree was a big decision, so I was hoping that the choice of NBS would make sense from both the academic and career angles. I have to say that the Career Office did not disappoint. The activities planned by the Office were well thought through and synced with the recruitment cycles of hiring companies.\nI have benefitted immensely from the help of my career counsellor who gave me career guidance and helped review my resume. The career counsellor simplified the world of internship for me and linked me to available internship opportunities. Knowing that the Career Office is ever ready to support me in my journey is a fantastic feeling and a big assurance to my life in NBS!\nZhang Yuejiao\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2021\nThe decision to leave a full-time job to pursue further studies during a global pandemic was certainly a major decision in my life. My choice of university was very much influenced by what its career office could offer, as I had positive experience with my career office during my undergraduate days in India. I was convinced that NTU was the right choice for me when I attended a programme briefing and the NBS Career Office gave useful information on the support level offered to participants of the programme.\nHaving embarked on the programme with NBS, I must say that the Career Office was everything I expected it to be, and more. The career counsellors in the Office were helpful and encouraging, and organised numerous talks to help participants understand our career options within different functions. Networking sessions with alumni and corporate partners widened our network for job opportunities.\nThe Career Office was also constantly sourcing for internships, and it was through one of these that I got my role with Johnson Controls Innovation Center. The support and guidance from the team has also helped me sharpen my career goals too. I am sure the invaluable support from the Office will continue into the future.\nVivek Goyal\nMSc Business Analytics Class of 2021\nComing from a university in the UK, I had assumed that career offices across all universities would offer similar services. I can now say with confidence that not all offices are the same – the proactive stance of the NBS Career Office sets it apart from the rest.\nApart from \"standard\" services like resume reviews and provision of a jobs portal, the approachable team in the NBS Career Office works to improve employability of every participant. From the start of my term, I worked with my career counsellor on a career development plan.\nWhat I also liked was the open-door policy of the Career Office, wherein I was able to approach any of the counsellors within the team to get insights into various sectors of interest.\nThe office also worked with other experts to equip participants with critical skills – my favourite was one where I learnt how to tell a better story about myself!\nOverall, the Careers team has impressed me with their future-oriented mindset and genuine passion in helping participants. I would recommend any participant interested in improving his or her employability to have a chat with their career counsellor soon!\nDaniel Rivera\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nI did my research prior to taking up my MBA programme. Institutional reputation, extent of alumni network and support of the career office were important considerations for me. For these reasons, I chose the Nanyang MBA. I am glad I did – to this day, I still ask the Career Office for advice on career because I trust them!\nWhen I started the Nanyang MBA, I did not know anyone in Singapore and had no idea how to go about searching for jobs in this country. Raised in Korea and having only worked in Europe, I benefitted immensely from the guidance given by the Career Office in a variety of areas, such as how to introduce myself over LinkedIn, how to get the most out of networking sessions, and how to pitch myself to prospective employers.\nThe Career Office also gave me the opportunity to meet with alumni and their stories of overcoming challenges, similar to what I faced, were very reassuring for me. My confidence in the Career Office was further strengthened when company recruiters attested to the level of effort put in by the Career Office in helping every participant get noticed by hiring managers. The team indeed showed true passion and they are the biggest asset from my NBS days!\nElla Choi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2018\nAPAC IT Data Project Manager, L’Oréal\nThe support provided by the Career Office was immensely helpful throughout my NBS journey. The Career Office lined up a series of workshops to get our resumes ready and equip us with essential interview skills even before we stepped into our first class. Throughout the semesters, the Career Office would also invite guest speakers from various companies to share experiences and provide valuable insights to help us make better and more informed career choices.\nWhat really helped was how the Career Office kept an eye out for opportunities for every participant, whether in the form of internships or full-time roles. This personalised approach was what helped me land my current role.\nThe Career Office was a key supporter through my journey with NBS, and I am glad that I made full use of the open-door policy of the team to get career coaching and counselling. These sessions were definitely more useful than I had initially thought!\nNigel Ng\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2020\nAnalyst, RV Capital\nMy Nanyang Professional MBA journey was truly enriching and fruitful. I received tremendous support in one-to-one coaching and in accessing career opportunities.  I also attended networking sessions and was notified of different job openings and recruitment sessions by renowned companies in various sectors.\nThanks to the Career Office, I successfully secured an interesting job, working directly with high-level stakeholders from around the region. It was through the Career Office that I got the opportunity to interview for this new role, in an industry which I had no prior professional experience in.\nIt was indeed a rare opportunity made possible by the Nanyang Professional MBA and the Career Office, for which I am extremely grateful.\nCheryl Chong\nNanyang Professional MBA Class of 2020\nBusiness Analyst, South Asia Country Group Management & Asia Sales and Client Management, Willis Towers Watson\nGraduating during the COVID-19 pandemic was unnerving, but the support of the Career Office made all the difference.\nFrom the start of the programme, I was given the opportunity to network with alumni and gained valuable insights into different industries and interview processes of several companies.  I also had a career coach who helped me uncover my true passion and worked with me to brand myself around who I truly am.\nWorking with the Career Office as a partner certainly helped me get the most out of my Nanyang MBA with NBS.\nLam Hao Zhi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2020\nManagement Associate, Dole Food Company\nDeloitte’s partnership with the Nanyang Business School (NBS) is a longstanding one. Graduates of NBS are well positioned to be the next generation of leaders, and we have had great success hiring NBS graduates for positions across our organisation. In the course of their work, they exhibit drive, professionalism and the willingness to learn – attributes that are essential in today’s dynamic workplace. We look forward to a continued relationship with NBS and help their graduates make an impact that matters in their roles at Deloitte.\nSeah Gek Choo\nDeloitte Singapore\nNTU and NBS have always been one of the most important university partners for JD.com in Singapore. Thanks to the dedication and support from the career services team at NBS, over the past years JD.com has organised many successful campus engagement events such as the NTU campus recruitment talk/interview day and the virtual JD open day, which attracted many NTU graduates who have become key talents at JD.com. We look forward to deepening our collaboration with NTU and NBS, and always welcome future NTU talent to the JD.com family.\nHan Huixian\nCampus Recruitment Manager, JD.com\nThe team in the Career Office has been highly proactive in maintaining connections with me.  I have been offered various opportunities to interact with and contribute back to the business school.
