The first half of the course focuses on financial reporting. The emphases are on the nature of accounting information and its uses and limitations. While the focus of the course is on the users' perspective, it is essential that the user understands the building blocks of accounting, the process by which the information is generated and the incentives underlying the preparation of the accounting information. A proper understanding of the accounting process would enable the user to understand the limitations of the accounting information, and to ask the appropriate questions when using the\ninformation.\nIn the second half of the course, we seek to understand how accounting information is used in planning, costing, decision making, and management control. The organizational architecture will be used as the organizing framework. The major topics covered include activity-based costing and management, tools for decision making such as cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, and performance evaluation and measurement including a discussion on sustainability issues and measurement\nof these objectives.\nQuantitative skills are important to measure and quantify the financial effects of business strategies.\nThus, good financial analysis of business issues is critical to improve business decisions.\nCourse Description:\nThis course introduces to the participants the key concepts of analytics, which are of growing importance within the modern organization. Participants will be introduced to the process and tools relating to business analytics. Using real-life case studies, participants will be given the opportunity to have hands-on experience on building analytical models that will guide decision marking for common business problems such as profit and revenue forecast, customer segmentation, and consumer trend analysis.\nThis course systematically introduces the process of developing a strong business analytic case starting from the exploration of the data context to finally obtaining the explanatory or predictive results. The participants will learn how to ask the right questions and how to draw inferences from the data by using the appropriate statical and data mining tools.\nOverall, the course will enable participants to approach business problems data-analytically, envision business analytics opportunities in organizations, and follow up on ideas or opportunities that present themselves.\nCourse Description:\nCorporate Governance & Ethics (CG&E) aims to further stimulate the mindset of leaders to balance the key, often conflicting priorities they face in leadership, in business, government and/or the not-for-profit work environment. The aim is to help you develop strategies to make difficult but crucial organizational decisions considering the dynamic external environment.\nCG&E seeks to provide insights into what it takes to develop and/or strengthen an effective governance structure to allow the organization to meet increasingly challenging goals aligned with different stakeholders’ sometimes conflicting needs. We will discuss pertinent and topical issues to provoke participants to think about what accountability and responsible risk-taking really mean and foster an understanding of incorporating and embedding ethical practices in your strategy.\nWe will cover Ethical Leadership; Corporate Social Responsibility; Anti-Bribery & Corruption and Corporate Governance.\nCourse Description:\nThis course is an intensive introduction to the principles and practice of financial management that managers should understand. The course orientation will be from practitioners’ point of view to make the content applicable to daily business decisions. The course will be taught through lectures, class discussion and case studies. Topics to cover include:\nTime value of money and its business applications\nThe importance of cashflows and how to calculate cashflows\nCapital budgeting decision\nCost of capital usage in financial strategy and how to estimate it\nFinancial planning\nManagement of short-term assets and liabilities\nCourse Description:\nIf I had my way, this course would be re-titled “Revolutionary Marketing in the Age of Turbulence, Hyper-competition, and Disruption”, because the environment in which businesses operate today is businesses (and even entire industries) face. In such an environment, marketing practices need to be nothing short of revolutionary. And in these extraordinary times, marketing can (and should) no longer be taught in a traditional manner. Gone are the days when companies could simply rely on efficient manufacturing operations to mass-produce products and on predictable processes to mass-advertise and distribute those products. Gone are the days when marketing was the job of a department whose executives could simply examine broad customer segments within well-defined product markets using structured survey reports. And gone are the days when the only “customers ”; brand owners needed to deal with and worry about were the distributors and resellers who did most of the nitty-gritty work of serving the end consumers and/or end users. Marketing today is much less predictable, much more cross-functional (and, indeed, much more a direct responsibility of the CEO), and much more fundamentally about, interacting and connecting with the end consumers and users.\nBut at the same time, marketing today is more important, exciting, and fun!\nThis course will approach the study of marketing from highly contemporary perspectives. Course activities will include discussions of marketing issues that have emerged “just yesterday” and marketing events that have occurred “this morning”. We will discuss the latest marketing challenges that companies face, and many examples of successful and unsuccessful marketing strategies, particularly of companies/brands in Asia. There will also be a “live” project sponsored by a company that will offer a unique opportunity for participants to work on solving a live marketing problem. In addition, as part of the “Marketing 2022 Case Study” series, we will examine companies’ marketing strategies from a future-oriented perspective. Participants, whether they are already experienced marketing professionals or are complete novices at marketing, can look forward to gaining profound insight into the role of marketing in today’s business organizations as well as practical knowledge of how to successfully lead the marketing function of a progressive, thriving, and growth-oriented business.\nCourse Description:\nCompanies, investors, and governments are under increasing pressure to change the way they interact with people and planet--to adopt more sustainable practices.  These changes do not come for free, however, but rather they may involve considerable monetary and non-monetary costs.  This course introduces students to the three pillars of sustainable  nance:  companies that have to do the work to become more sustainable, investors that provide the  nancing while accommodating a wide range of attitudes towards sustainability, and governments that set regulations to incentivize good--and discourage bad--behaviors.  Throughout the course we will review current developments around the world, re ecting the fact that companies and countries may be moving in different directions and at a different pace.  For example, case studies will draw from cutting-edge legislation in Europe and follow-on efforts in ASEAN that re ect the vastly different starting point of less-developed economies.  Interactive lectures will provide opportunity for class participation as well as short individual and group exercises.\nCourse Description:\nThe aim of this course is to determine and understand forces impacting the global financial market. It treats central banking policy as a major force in shaping capital movements and market dynamics. Some of the questions the course will attempt to answer are: How do central banking policies impact the global financial market? What are key economic and market indicators that can help us determine the direction of the financial market. Participants interested in a career in of asset and wealth management, capital markets and trading should take this course.\nCourse Description:\nOperations is the core of the business that is concerned with the design, operation and improvement of systems concerned with the production of goods and services. Operations account for a significant percentage of the value added and cost in any business. Therefore, even a small advantage in operations can make the difference between winners and losers in a competitive marketplace.\nContent Description:\nThis course focuses on the strategic thinking process that helps companies achieve sustained high performance. It includes a continual and integrative process of \"making sense\" of internal and external situations, \"making choices\" to capture value at the corporate and business levels, \"making it happen\" to achieve the desired future status of the company, and \"making revisions\" to adapt to unexpected situations. It thus deals with the essential issues for short and long-term competitive positions and the primary responsibility of senior decision-makers in a company.\nThe course begins with a fundamental strategic question of what it takes to build a sustained high-performance organization. A review of classic studies on the subject leads to the first task of \"sensing strategic situations\", which introduces tools to analyse external and internal situations facing a company. While the external analysis helps managers to understand the trends in macro environments, competitive situations and competitors' behaviours, the internal analysis tries to identify and develop the source of core competences and sustained advantages. The course then moves to the task of \"making strategic choices\" at the business and corporate levels that are to secure competitive advantages in a specific market and to expand the boundary of the firm for sustained long-term growth, respectively. The next topic addresses strategy implementation, involving the tasks of \"making it happen\" and \"making revisions\". This subject discusses the content of strategy execution, organizational structure, and strategic transformation. The course concludes by discussing how to manage sustained firm growth in emerging markets that are much different from the developed markets in institutional settings, market dynamics, and consumer behaviours.\nCorporate purpose and high-performance organizations\nIndustry and competitive analysis\nCourse Description:\nThe course is organised and presented from the perspective of managerial end users of IT. It is designed to prepare future business executives for proactive leadership roles and responsibilities in a world which is being constantly challenged and\nshaped by IT and other digital technologies.\nThe course focuses on concepts and applications rather than on specific technologies, techniques, or methodologies. The emphasis is on the development of enabling frameworks and conceptual models for better understanding of the deployment of IT and\nthe Internet. The course makes liberal use of examples, case studies and other illustrations to provide examples of best practices and success stories. In this regard, the participants, who come from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, are encouraged\nto share their own experiences and views.\nCourse Description:\nCorporate Sustainability deals with strategies, activities, processes and structures that can help organizations sustain themselves as well as their people, natural resources and communities for the long run.\nThe negative impact created on the society and environment by industrial operations has resulted in increasing pressures from NGOs, civil society, and other stakeholders on corporations to adopt more sustainable and socially responsible practices in all their activities - right from sourcing to distribution, and to how the products and packaging is handled at the end of a use cycle. Corporate sustainability and responsibility have therefore become a key concern for the board members, shareholders as well as market regulators. Sustainability reporting is now a requirement in many countries, including Singapore.\nThough climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humankind, the United Nations in consultation with various stakeholders have developed 17 Sustainable development goals that firms are encouraged to pursue. A firm can mitigate the negative impact of its operations on the environment and the community through innovation and by adoption of appropriate technologies and methodologies.\nCourse Description:\nColonization and annexation of other states through military conquests were used historically to extend a nation’s theatre of influence, and to extract maximum benefits from its subsequent vassal states. Today, a country can exert its influence on other nation states through various methods beyond the conventional military option. This, in essence, is what geopolitics is all about, and it has tremendous implications on the relations among nation states as well as on how business corporations operate, especially in this highly inter-connected world.\nThe conventional “within-the-box” decision-making for a company is no longer tenable nor sustainable. With the fast changing and increased influence of politics into business (e.g. the Huawei saga, the blacklisting of many Chinese high-technology companies by the US government, the formation of new blocs like AUKUS, increased tension in South China Sea, etc.), companies that have international operations have realized that they need to be aware of the mega trends and geopolitical factors that can impact their corporate strategies. The need and urgency to take a holistic and long- term view, especially to factor in political “interventions” by various foreign governments, is now a reality that business corporations must learn to face. The increased conflict between China and the US is a very illustrative example. Started as a trade conflict between the two countries, it has escalated to other areas of conflicts, and a new cold war is fast developing. Under President Joe Biden, the US have lobbied aggressively Western countries like Britain, Australia, and Canada, and even Asian countries like Japan and India, into their “fight” against China. All these, inevitably, have boiled down to geopolitical wars between these Western allies against China, and the latter has also stepped up its campaigns and lobbies against the Western world.\nThis half-module course will cover real-life and current geopolitical issues of the day, and how they impact business policy. As China and US are the two major and most significant players that will influence the future of the world, including how they are extending their respective global influence, a significant portion of this course will pivot towards addressing issues between these two super-powers. The course will conclude with some pointers on how companies could respond to the various geopolitical challenges.\nThe contents of the course will include, but not limited to the following topics:\nUnderstanding geopolitics and the impact on business operations\nUnderstanding the different kinds of geopolitical risks and how to manage them\nDeveloping effective business policies via insightful geopolitical world\nAssessing the changing trends and landscape in the geopolitical world\nAnalysis and implications of the China-US conflict and their impact on the rest of the world and business operations\nUnderstanding the tools/vehicles that can be used for geopolitics\nDevelop a holistic and long-term perspective of the symbiotic relationship between business and geopolitics\nAs part of the learning process, each group of participants will be given the opportunity to \"deep-dive\" into specific geopolitical issues/topics that affect business operations and will present their findings in allocated class discussions/presentations during the course. This will form a very rich and insightful learning experience for all participants.\nCourse Description:\nChange is the only constant in our uncertain and volatile global environment. Successful organizations skilfully, initiate, embrace, and crystalize the learning that comes from change. The result is competitive advantage that can be sustained from the short to long term. This course is designed for aspiring change agents: People who lead, manage, and facilitate the change process as decision makers, managers, and consultants. We will adopt a mix of business case experience and theoretical frameworks to understand how businesses succeed or fail in initiating, navigating, and sustaining change. We will analyse both regional and international business contexts and the human, systemic, economic, and environmental forces that both necessitate and impede the change process within them. Our journey will take us into the minds of leaders of some of the world’s most prominent and recognized organizations, where we will examine their cultures, systems, decision, and psychology at work. In-class exercises will expose individual mindsets and approaches to managing change, to improve self-awareness of the type of change agents we can be. Participants will be challenged to analyse change as a complex multi-faceted phenomenon, learning to consider issues related to (a) recognizing the need for change; (b) targeting what needs to be changed; (c) dealing with people issues related to change; (d) planning, implementing, and evaluating change; and (e) sustaining change.\nCourse Description:\nThe objective of this course is to study corporate mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and restructurings and the strategic, valuation, financial, governance and other issues related to these activities. The course is case study based. The cases to be discussed in the course include those involving mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts/management buyouts, divestitures, spin offs and privatisations.\nCourse Description:\nBlockchain is a decentralized and transparent ledger technology. It offers a distributed and secure approach of verifying, storing, and managing data. As part of the suite of technologies expected to drive digital transformation, blockchain has the potential to transform the way of doing business across industries. This technology may disrupt how organizations are managed, how they create value, and even how they interact across their value chains. There are many strategic issues in designing business models and operations when blockchain is implemented. This course provides the foundation for students to learn about key characteristics and various use cases for blockchain, as well as enabling students to understand business opportunities, challenges, and even the dark side associated with implementation of blockchain.\nCourse Description:\nWith the growing threats of technological disruption, the race for digital transformation has begun. However, many organizations are struggling to develop an effective approach to realize the value of their digital transformation efforts. Executives have diverse perspectives as to what “going digital” really means. 74% of respondents in a Forrester survey feel that their companies do not fully understand the potential of digital to change value creation. How do you reimagine the future to craft the digital business strategy? How do you drive digital transformation to get there?\nThis course seeks to deepen the understanding on various aspects of digital transformation. We will consolidate the state of digital transformation landscape and explore new opportunities and threats arising from emerging new technologies. We will also discuss the implications for business strategies and organizational transformation. Through discussion of actual cases of digital transformation, the salient features of these strategies are explicated. Issues such as organizational structuring for digital transformation, building of digital capabilities, cultivation of digital culture, and the measurement of digital value creation are also addressed. Executives need to realize that successful digital transformation requires more than the pursuit of the latest technological innovation.\nThis course thus aims to deepen the understanding on digital transformation and unpack its variation under different contexts of technological disruption. Executives should develop a good appreciation that digital transformation requires much more than the pursuit of the latest technological innovation, and gain new insights on how they can embark on the digital transformation journey to begin building a more agile enterprise to be future-ready.\nCourse Description:\nThe Emerging Market Study Mission course is a course in the Professional MBA programme that aims to introduce students to an emerging market to provide them with practical understanding of the opportunities presented by emerging markets and conducting business in such a market. To do this, the school will be organising a 5-day segment overseas where students will undergo teaching sessions with faculty, guest speakers, visit companies and organisations in an emerging market, experience cultural immersion, and learn about regional business practices and trends.\nStrategy Projects At Nanyang (SPAN)\nis an educational collaboration between industry partners and Nanyang Business School. With SPAN, MBA participants will have a unique opportunity to work with organisations on live strategy\nconsulting projects.\nSPAN is a core, capstone course that encourages Nanyang MBA participants to apply the latest business thinking and insights to analyse market opportunities and address business challenges of our sponsor organisations.\nAll Nanyang PMBA participants will have the ​unique ​​​opportunity to work on a “live” consulting project with a sponsor company.\nThese projects are carefully curated to expose you to a spectrum of real-world problems faced by companies based in a variety of industry sectors.\nPartner organisations r​epresent a variety of industry sectors:\nLeading\nPeople Globally\naims to give participants both theoretical and practical understanding of what is required to lead people in organisations, whether locally or globally, where cultures and practices may be\nsimilar or different.\nParticipants will gain insights about their own leadership competencies and will get a chance to further develop many of them.

      "content": "Greetings from the Graduate Studies Career Development Office, better known as GSCDO.\nNanyang Business School is viewed as a key recruiting partner by many Fortune 500 corporations and social impact organisations. And here at GSCDO, we work hard to prepare our postgraduate participants for the workforce.\nA dedicated go-to career counsellor looks after each graduate programme, working with our participants in a multitude of areas such as career planning, job hunting strategies, and linking participants to industry and alumni contacts. All of our career counsellors hail from industry and they bring with them deep insights into, and strong connections within, industries of interest to our participants.\nGSCDO also curates a suite of career workshops, covering important topics such as professional etiquette, networking, resume writing, and interview preparation.  These are aimed at ensuring that participants meet the high demands of employers and stand out from the competition.\nOur efforts have yielded good returns – each year, we achieve high employment rates for all our programmes.

With your effort and our support, we believe that you will find the NBS days a rewarding journey indeed!\nAssoc Prof Ivy Kwan\nAssistant Dean (Career Service)\nGraduate Studies Career Development Office\nAt GSCDO, we are a team of professionals dedicated to supporting your career journey.

There were also networking sessions that provided avenues for me to connect with alumni and industry experts.\nKimberly Liew Bei Xin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nAs a sponsored participant with my career locked in for the next few years, I was initially sceptical about how the Career Office could add value to my learning journey with NBS. However, my scepticism was debunked during orientation, when I understood how the Career Office partnered each participant through a structured career journey during our time with NBS and beyond.\nFrom resume building and profiling activities to customised workshops in topics ranging from personal branding to sharing developments within specific industries and sectors, I saw how the Career Office worked to cater to the diverse needs and interests of every participant.\nI took part in some of these workshops and picked up skills which I believe would remain relevant to me throughout my career. What I have also found beneficial was the one-to-one career coaching sessions, from which I not only gained clarity over my career purpose, but also gleaned valuable insights about areas to work on for my personal growth.\nAnthony Chor Xingyou\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nThe Career Office works with participants one-on-one to provide tailored career services through skill workshops, networking sessions, career coaching, and many more. The team also provides many exclusive resources for both full-time and part-time job opportunities.\nI personally found my internship through the Career Office’s network and support, including resume workshops, company visits, and personal coaching sessions. With the strong support, I can rest assured that the Nanyang MBA program will help me elevate my career to the next level.\nChris Lin\nNanyang MBA Class of 2021\nI first learnt about the Career Office during orientation. Since then, I have interacted closely with the team in the office and gained guidance in fine-tuning my resume and understanding potential roles for me to explore.\nThe office also organised networking events and seminars which were helpful in getting me career ready. My favourite has been the personal branding workshop, which helped me better communicate and present who I am.\nA key highlight was also the personal career coach who worked with me to leverage my transferable skills and move into my ideal roles. The Career Office is indeed one’s best friend during this NBS journey, helping set NBS apart from other global MBA programmes.\nLorybeth Rugay Baldrias-Serrano\nNanyang Fellows MBA Class of 2021\nI deeply appreciate the support of the NBS Career Office in guiding me along the job search process.  My career counsellor helped alleviate the apprehension I felt about job interviews. Feedback during mock interviews and from video sessions helped me gain a lot of self-awareness, and I am now more confident of myself during interviews.\nThe Career Office has also been fabulous in tapping into the rich pool of alumni, which NBS has. Through alumni engagement sessions, I had the chance to hear the experience of those now working in companies such as Microsoft, Twitter, Goggle, and P&G. The experience and perspectives shared by these alumni have given me a clearer understanding of my career prospects, and I am deeply grateful to the Career Office for this.\nZhu Siyi\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nReturning to school for a postgraduate degree was a big decision, so I was hoping that the choice of NBS would make sense from both the academic and career angles. I have to say that the Career Office did not disappoint. The activities planned by the Office were well thought through and synced with the recruitment cycles of hiring companies.\nI have benefitted immensely from the help of my career counsellor who gave me career guidance and helped review my resume. The career counsellor simplified the world of internship for me and linked me to available internship opportunities. Knowing that the Career Office is ever ready to support me in my journey is a fantastic feeling and a big assurance to my life in NBS!\nZhang Yuejiao\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2021\nThe decision to leave a full-time job to pursue further studies during a global pandemic was certainly a major decision in my life. My choice of university was very much influenced by what its career office could offer, as I had positive experience with my career office during my undergraduate days in India. I was convinced that NTU was the right choice for me when I attended a programme briefing and the NBS Career Office gave useful information on the support level offered to participants of the programme.\nHaving embarked on the programme with NBS, I must say that the Career Office was everything I expected it to be, and more. The career counsellors in the Office were helpful and encouraging, and organised numerous talks to help participants understand our career options within different functions. Networking sessions with alumni and corporate partners widened our network for job opportunities.\nThe Career Office was also constantly sourcing for internships, and it was through one of these that I got my role with Johnson Controls Innovation Center. The support and guidance from the team has also helped me sharpen my career goals too. I am sure the invaluable support from the Office will continue into the future.\nVivek Goyal\nMSc Business Analytics Class of 2021\nComing from a university in the UK, I had assumed that career offices across all universities would offer similar services. I can now say with confidence that not all offices are the same – the proactive stance of the NBS Career Office sets it apart from the rest.\nApart from \"standard\" services like resume reviews and provision of a jobs portal, the approachable team in the NBS Career Office works to improve employability of every participant. From the start of my term, I worked with my career counsellor on a career development plan.\nWhat I also liked was the open-door policy of the Career Office, wherein I was able to approach any of the counsellors within the team to get insights into various sectors of interest.\nThe office also worked with other experts to equip participants with critical skills – my favourite was one where I learnt how to tell a better story about myself!\nOverall, the Careers team has impressed me with their future-oriented mindset and genuine passion in helping participants. I would recommend any participant interested in improving his or her employability to have a chat with their career counsellor soon!\nDaniel Rivera\nMSc Marketing Science Class of 2021\nI did my research prior to taking up my MBA programme. Institutional reputation, extent of alumni network and support of the career office were important considerations for me. For these reasons, I chose the Nanyang MBA. I am glad I did – to this day, I still ask the Career Office for advice on career because I trust them!\nWhen I started the Nanyang MBA, I did not know anyone in Singapore and had no idea how to go about searching for jobs in this country. Raised in Korea and having only worked in Europe, I benefitted immensely from the guidance given by the Career Office in a variety of areas, such as how to introduce myself over LinkedIn, how to get the most out of networking sessions, and how to pitch myself to prospective employers.\nThe Career Office also gave me the opportunity to meet with alumni and their stories of overcoming challenges, similar to what I faced, were very reassuring for me. My confidence in the Career Office was further strengthened when company recruiters attested to the level of effort put in by the Career Office in helping every participant get noticed by hiring managers. The team indeed showed true passion and they are the biggest asset from my NBS days!\nElla Choi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2018\nAPAC IT Data Project Manager, L’Oréal\nThe support provided by the Career Office was immensely helpful throughout my NBS journey. The Career Office lined up a series of workshops to get our resumes ready and equip us with essential interview skills even before we stepped into our first class. Throughout the semesters, the Career Office would also invite guest speakers from various companies to share experiences and provide valuable insights to help us make better and more informed career choices.\nWhat really helped was how the Career Office kept an eye out for opportunities for every participant, whether in the form of internships or full-time roles. This personalised approach was what helped me land my current role.\nThe Career Office was a key supporter through my journey with NBS, and I am glad that I made full use of the open-door policy of the team to get career coaching and counselling. These sessions were definitely more useful than I had initially thought!\nNigel Ng\nMSc Financial Engineering Class of 2020\nAnalyst, RV Capital\nMy Nanyang Professional MBA journey was truly enriching and fruitful. I received tremendous support in one-to-one coaching and in accessing career opportunities.  I also attended networking sessions and was notified of different job openings and recruitment sessions by renowned companies in various sectors.\nThanks to the Career Office, I successfully secured an interesting job, working directly with high-level stakeholders from around the region. It was through the Career Office that I got the opportunity to interview for this new role, in an industry which I had no prior professional experience in.\nIt was indeed a rare opportunity made possible by the Nanyang Professional MBA and the Career Office, for which I am extremely grateful.\nCheryl Chong\nNanyang Professional MBA Class of 2020\nBusiness Analyst, South Asia Country Group Management & Asia Sales and Client Management, Willis Towers Watson\nGraduating during the COVID-19 pandemic was unnerving, but the support of the Career Office made all the difference.\nFrom the start of the programme, I was given the opportunity to network with alumni and gained valuable insights into different industries and interview processes of several companies.  I also had a career coach who helped me uncover my true passion and worked with me to brand myself around who I truly am.\nWorking with the Career Office as a partner certainly helped me get the most out of my Nanyang MBA with NBS.\nLam Hao Zhi\nNanyang MBA Class of 2020\nManagement Associate, Dole Food Company\nDeloitte’s partnership with the Nanyang Business School (NBS) is a longstanding one. Graduates of NBS are well positioned to be the next generation of leaders, and we have had great success hiring NBS graduates for positions across our organisation. In the course of their work, they exhibit drive, professionalism and the willingness to learn – attributes that are essential in today’s dynamic workplace. We look forward to a continued relationship with NBS and help their graduates make an impact that matters in their roles at Deloitte.\nSeah Gek Choo\nDeloitte Singapore\nNTU and NBS have always been one of the most important university partners for JD.com in Singapore. Thanks to the dedication and support from the career services team at NBS, over the past years JD.com has organised many successful campus engagement events such as the NTU campus recruitment talk/interview day and the virtual JD open day, which attracted many NTU graduates who have become key talents at JD.com. We look forward to deepening our collaboration with NTU and NBS, and always welcome future NTU talent to the JD.com family.\nHan Huixian\nCampus Recruitment Manager, JD.com\nThe team in the Career Office has been highly proactive in maintaining connections with me.  I have been offered various opportunities to interact with and contribute back to the business school. I look forward to continuing the warm and steadfast partnership with the Career Office.\nLeo Tan\nOperations Deal Manager,\nMicrosoft Operations",
