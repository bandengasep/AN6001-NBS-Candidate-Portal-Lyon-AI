Overseas segments are subject to reaffirmation of current year agreements with our partner universities.\nComplementing the Nanyang EMBA curriculum, the\nStrategic Career Management for Leaders\nand\nStrategy Projects at Nanyang (SPAN)\nare included throughout the programme to provide a holistic learning experience.\nStrategic Career Management for Leaders:\nA specially-curated programme to meet the unique needs of our EMBA participants, the Strategic Career Management helps to accelerate your career goals through 1-1 coaching sessions and leadership\nworkshops.\nStrategy Projects at Nanyang (SPAN):\nYou will take on a live consulting project, working in groups of 4-5, aimed at honing your critical thinking skills and inter-disciplinary knowledge. In this module, you will have the unique\nopportunity to recommend projects from your company to the class.\nCourse Description\nThe aim of this course is to introduce the design and use of management accounting information for planning, control and decision making within business organisations. The organisational architecture will be used as the organizing framework. The major\ntopics covered in this course include product costing, activity-based costing and management, transfer pricing issues, tools for decision making such as cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, and performance evaluation and measurement. The course also\nincludes a discussion on sustainability issues and possible measurement of these objectives.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand managerial accounting concepts and terminology and learn about cost behaviour and cost classifications\nUnderstand the methods of product/service costing and why they are important\nBe able to apply the quantitative tools to various decisions faced by managers and for strategic planning\nUnderstand the various financial and non-financial performance measures and how they are used to establish effective control\nCourse Description\nThe global economy presents many opportunities and challenges for businesses and their leaders. Senior executives need to develop a repertoire of strategic leadership capabilities to remain effective. One of the most important capabilities needed is cultural\nintelligence (CQ) – the ability to function effectively across a variety of cultural contexts. This course will equip participants with a working understanding of Cultural intelligence (CQ) and its relevance to their industry and organisation.\nLearning Objectives\nTo understand the cultural intelligence framework and its implications for executives working in global industries\nTo enhance their awareness of their strengths and weaknesses in managing cross-cultural situations\nTo enhance their repertoire of strategic leadership capabilities\nTo develop a plan for enhancing cultural intelligence personally and throughout their organisation\nTo discern the different dimensions of national culture and the underlying assumptions of one’s own cultural perspective\nTo understand what culture is and the different spheres of culture (national, regional, industry, company, etc.)\nCourse Description\nThis course will focus on strategies for acquiring, managing, and retaining talent. Students will learn about different ways to think about “talent” and how to find, engage, and retain it to fulfil organisations’ strategic\nobjectives.  Some selected talent management theories and models will be complemented by “best practice” case studies and discussions of your own managerial experiences.\nCourse Description\nGlobal supply chains play a vital role in today’s economy because efficient and responsive supply chains not only help companies improve profitability but also allow customers to receive better products at lower prices and better\nservice levels. In this course, participants will learn the key techniques and strategies in managing global supply chains; namely, network design, inventory, and replenishment processes, designing efficient versus responsive supply chains, contracting\nand strategic procurement, and implications of emerging technologies. This knowledge will help participants to enhance supply chain efficiencies, manage economic risks, optimize network performance, and apply best practices and new technologies to\ncreate superior supply chain value.\nGlobal supply chains are critical building blocks in value creation for any organisation or industry. Managing them is a complex endeavour which would benefit from attention to detail in finding opportunities for performance improvement. This means that\nparticipants must first understand the nature, structure, challenges as well as drivers of supply chain performance. Thereafter, they will need to be exposed to best practices like modularization, postponement, among others, as well as to learn optimization\ntools such as network design and inventory control.\nLearning Objectives\nProvide an understanding and appreciation of key challenges and drivers in managing global supply chains\nExpose participants to techniques and strategies used to optimize supply chain decisions and to anticipate or explain supply chain phenomena\nCourse Description\nThe pervasiveness and impact of IT, in all its forms, is ubiquitous. Technological change and the speed, manifested in new devices and gadgets and software, is clear to all. What is more of a challenge is our ability to comprehend their subtle impacts\nand then of course to cope with them. What should businesses do and how can they prepare for this disruptive landscape? In an era where new traditional industries are being challenges by new technology competitors, where rules of the game are being\nchanged so dramatically that incumbents who were monopolies are going bankrupt, it is imperative to step back and take a fundamental look at the new economics of the digital world.\nThis course is about understanding such issues and to ultimately surface patterns of IT-driven change and strategies. Through case studies of multiple companies in varied industries, we will try and understand how IT is reshaping the economic landscape\nby offering new ways to gather information, compete based on value-added knowledge, and providing new ways to coordinate and connect.\nSince the Internet has motivated much of this disruption, our class discussions pertain to the context of online companies who in a short period of time have become giants in their own rights. And that is also because participants’ experience in\ntraditional industries then offers a rich context to contrast the old vs. the new, and that is the contribution expected of everyone in the class.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstanding important IT management issues and developments\nExamination of key technologies and their strategic value and disruptive potential\nExamine how companies are becoming more knowledge – driven and using innovation and intellectual property as strategic resources\nThe viability of technology-driven business opportunities – how value is created, what are the critical costs associated with creating this value, and to what extent a sustainable competitive advantage can be maintained that is based on IT\nCourse Description\nThe objective is to inculcate an understanding of the various functions of the financial manager and how these functions relate to the overall business of the firm. The major topics covered include risk and return, cost of capital, capital budgeting,\ncapital structure determination, and the dividend policy.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand the various aspects of financial management to maximize the value of the organisation\nEvaluate strategic choices involved in capital budgeting, including estimation of project cash flows, measurement of cost of capital and appropriate mix of various sources of funds\nCourse Description\nThis course is designed to help participants develop strong conceptual foundations for understanding design thinking and identifying opportunities in the latest technologies such as Blockchain and AI. It is important to recognize the\ndifferent types of technology innovations and the role that they play in organisations and society.\nThe latest technologies bring about many opportunities for firms. A sound understanding of the latest technologies, coupled with the design thinking framework that helps business leaders to understand how to spot business opportunities amidst the cry\nfor using such latest technologies, is critical for today’s leaders.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand fundamental concepts and principles of design thinking and how it is applied to various organisations\nLearn to apply different design research techniques for opportunity identification\nExamine how firms may utilize the latest technologies to leverage on business opportunities\nUnderstand the basics of blockchain and challenges with using and implementing the technology\nUnderstand the basics of AI, ethics of AI and the latest industry trends related to AI\nCourse Description\nThe brands that a firm has invested in and developed over time are typically their most valuable assets. Product designs, manufacturing processes and other business processes may be easily copied, but a strong brand is something that\ncannot be easily reproduced.\nMany Asian companies are coming to terms with the importance of branding and are putting more resources into building a strong brand. This is evident from the number of branding awards (e.g., Singapore Promising Brand Award, Readers’ Digest Most\nTrusted Brand Award etc) being handed out in recent years. Companies are also paying top dollars for branding managers.\nThis course aims to inform students about the current theories and findings on how firms manage brands and how consumers (in particular Asian consumers) view brands.\nLearning Objectives\nThis course aims to help participants acquire a good understanding of the branding strategies and factors affecting consumers’ reactions to these strategies. We will discuss how cultures may affect the effectiveness of different\nstrategies and how Asian consumers view brands in general.\nCourse Description\nThis course aims to develop your understanding of the main analytical techniques and conceptual frameworks to understand the drivers of profitability and change in industries and competitive markets.\nYou will also reflect and create a capability development roadmap to enhance your professional contribution and leadership to transform your organisations.\nLearning Objectives\nIntroduce participants to the concepts of strategy, value, and advantage\nDevelop an understanding of the main analytical techniques to assess firms’ competitive positions and apply them to specific situations\nDevelop an appreciation of the economic theory underlying strategic choices across the business and corporate strategies\nDifferentiate between business models and business strategy\nTo consider and discuss how strategic capabilities may be developed and deepened in your organisation so that you may achieve strategic outcomes for the organisation\nCourse Description\nThis course introduces to the participants the key concepts of analytics, which are of growing importance within the modern organisation. Participants will be introduced to the process and tools relating to business analytics. Using real-life\ncase studies, participants will be given the opportunity to have hands-on experience on building analytical models that will guide decision marking for common business problems such as profit and revenue forecast, customer segmentation, and consumer\ntrend analysis.\nThis course systematically introduces the process of developing a strong business analytic case starting from the exploration of the data context to finally obtaining the explanatory or predictive results. The students will learn how to ask the right\nquestions and how to draw inferences from the data by using the appropriate statistical and data mining tools.\nOverall, the course will enable students to approach business problems data-analytically, envision business analytics opportunities in organisations, and also follow up on ideas or opportunities that present themselves.\nLearning Objectives\nProblem formulation in business analytics\nIntroduce various statistical applications, tools and analytical applications which are applied in various business contexts\nDiscuss the various concepts and cases of statistical applications\nExamine supervised learning methods, such as classification and prediction\nExamine unsupervised learning methods, such as association rules and clustering\nCourse Description\nThe course aims to provide the participants an in-depth understanding of economic principles and the interactions between the macroeconomic policies and the private sector in the areas that are applicable to managers. The course covers\neconomic principles and content with 3 main focuses that are essential to the decision-making of business managers. Firstly, the course explains economic elements facing any business i.e. consumer behaviors of their clients and the business cost structure.\nSecondly, the course explains different market structures that firms are in with the aim of providing participants an ability to plan strategic response to successfully navigate the business. And lastly, the course explains interactions between some\nmajor government macroeconomic policies that their impact on the business and the society at large.\nThe course is designed with the audience who are business practitioners in mind. The focus will be on economic topics that business managers will need to incorporate into their analyses of the markets, industry structure, business-government interactions\nand business strategies suitable for competing under various market environments.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand how a rational individual makes economic decisions\nExplain important economic issues that enable students to understand the economic behaviours of their customers, and the plan competitive strategies suitable for their business environments\nEnable students to understand daily economic events they see in the media\nCourse Description\nWith the growing threats of technological disruption, the race for digital transformation has begun. However, many organisations are struggling to develop an effective approach to realize the value of their digital transformation efforts.\nExecutives have diverse perspectives as to what “going digital” really means. 74% of respondents in a Forrester survey also feel that their companies do not fully understand the potential of digital to change value creation. How do you\nreimagine the future to craft the digital business strategy? How do you drive digital transformation to get there?\nLearning Objectives\nThis course thus aims to deepen the understanding on digital transformation and unpack its variation under different contexts of technological disruption. Investing in more digital initiatives does not necessarily lead to a stronger digital\ntransformation strategy. Executives should develop a good appreciation that digital transformation requires much more than the pursuit of the latest technological innovation, and also gain new insights on HOW they can embark on the digital transformation\njourney to begin building a more agile enterprise to be future-ready.\nCourse Description\nNegotiation is essential not only in a professional or business context, but also in social and personal settings. Strong negotiation skills are therefore an important prerequisite for professional and personal success. You are a good\nnegotiator if you can get what you want from your negotiating counterparts; you are an excellent negotiator if those negotiating counterparts are happy to deal with you again. Good negotiation skills can be innate; excellent negotiation skills require\ncareful thought and attention to the process.\nThis module is designed to allow you to have a deeper understanding of your own negotiation strengths and weaknesses, to equip you with the tools and framework for analysing and preparing for negotiations, and to help you hone the negotiation skills so\ncrucial for success in leadership roles and in dealings with internal as well as external parties. This module adopts a variety of instructional methods, from lectures, videos and discussions to experiential learning through role-playing and simulation\nexercises.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand basic principles of negotiation\nUtilise a framework for negotiation\nPrepare for, and conduct, negotiations in a structured manner\nEstablish and maintain relationships in a negotiation\nAdapt negotiation strategies and tactics in different contexts and settings\nCourse Description\nThe rapid expansion of the Asian consumer market has prompted global multinationals to concentrate their efforts on building brands that have both global and local appeal.  In a region characterised by considerable cross-cultural\ndifferences, the need for accurate Asian market research (MR) has become a priority.  But with new products failing at a staggering 80% each year, companies are now turning to psychology and neuroscience to help them predict more accurately how\nconsumers will behave.\nOver the last few decades, neuroscientists have made remarkable progress in understanding how our brains shape and determine our behaviour. The introduction of brain scanners in the latter part of the last century allowed scientists to peer inside the\nhuman brain during normal behavior and uncover the mechanisms by which we feel, think and act. We now know that some 90% of our behavior is driven by subconscious brain processes and that our emotions, not our conscious thoughts, that are largely\nresponsible for the decisions we make.\nIn this module, students will learn how the new tools in the field of neuromarketing are being applied across a wide range of industry sectors and at all stages of the brand journey, to capture consumers’ implicit or subconscious feelings, biases\nand beliefs about products, brands and marketing messages. They will learn how memories are formed and influenced, how perception can be influenced by subtle environmental cues and how to measure and extract these powerful subconscious responses that\ncan predict subsequent purchasing behavior with greater accuracy than spoken feedback.\nAttendees will also learn about the pros and cons of the different neuromarketing tools, the questions that each method is typically best placed to address as well as how to commission research from practitioners in this field.\nLearning Objectives\nThe course is designed to provide students with a practical understanding of how psychological and neuroscientific (often referred to as “neuromarketing”) techniques can be applied at all stages of the brand journey to gain\ngreater insight into consumer behaviour and produce products and brands that have a much higher chance of succeeding in the marketplace.  This knowledge will be gained through lectures, group participation, demonstrations and exposure to actual\nmarketing briefs and guest speakers using these approaches across different industry sectors.\nCourse Description\nCorporate Sustainability deals with strategies, activities, processes and structures that can help organizations sustain themselves as well as their people, natural resources and communities for the long run.\nThe negative impact created on the society and environment by industrial operations has resulted in increasing pressures from NGOs, civil society, and other stakeholders on corporations to adopt more sustainable and socially responsible practices in all\ntheir activities - right from sourcing to distribution, and to how the products and packaging is handled at the end of a use cycle. Corporate sustainability and responsibility have therefore become a key concern for the board members, shareholders\nas well as market regulators. Sustainability reporting is now a requirement in many countries, including Singapore.\nA firm can mitigate the negative impact of its operations on the environment and the community through innovation and by adoption of appropriate technologies and methodologies.\nLearning Objectives\nHave an appreciation of the key issues in corporate sustainability\nUnderstand how to read sustainability reports and evaluate sustainability challenges in specific industries\nHave a good understanding of the specific issues in corporate sustainability that is covered in the class\nCourse Description\nThis course will explore the reasons and motivations for mergers and acquisitions and will examine the strategic considerations in planning and implementing a merger or acquisition, in either a friendly or hostile environment. The tools\nand techniques of valuation, including leverage buyout transactions will be reviewed. The acquisition process will be discussed in detail, including the confidentiality agreement, bid process, due diligence, closing and implementation. The aim is\nto provide an understanding of the strategic, cost, valuation, structure, financial, legal, accounting, negotiation and implementation issues associated with mergers and acquisitions.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand the underlying dynamics of M&A, including various motivating factors, the role of various participants, analysis of various merger waves and benefits to target and acquiring firms\nUnderstand various methods of valuations, including leverage buyouts\nDevelop understanding of strategic choices involved in acquisitions, including development of acquisition plans, payment methods, takeover defences and achieving value enhancing growth\nCourse Description\nThis course moves beyond the “myth” of the lone genius inventor/entrepreneur to highlight the reality of what Dr. Kurt Beyer calls Systems of Innovation.  Though individual inventors and entrepreneurs can be important\nagents of change, they are embedded in and dependent on a matrix of individuals, organisations, technologies, and institutions.\nLearning Objectives\nSilicon Valley Eco-system: The San Francisco Bay Area has been the technological innovation leader for over a half-century. We will explore the pillars of this unique geographic region\nTechnical Systems: We are surrounded by mature technical systems (gas-powered transportation), more recent technical systems (the internet), and emerging technical systems (digital currency).  We will learn the framework for how these systems\ncommence, grow, and mature\nEntrepreneurs: Bay Area entrepreneurs are playing a role in the unfolding of the 4th Industrial Revolution. We will learn how entrepreneurs evaluate opportunities, create strategies, manage risks, and reduce resource requirements through lean experimentation,\nstaged investing, and the use of related tactics\nCorporate Innovation: As companies grow and mature, they tend to lose the ability to innovate. We will explore the causes of this rigidness and consider ways for management to overcome it\nCourse Description\nThis course is all about maximizing human potential – your own, your team’s, and your organisation's. You will learn innovative leadership tools for establishing and managing prosperous firms while simultaneously creating\na thriving career for yourself. Leadership is about coordinating the skills, talents, and resources of individuals and groups in those combinations that best realize the organisation’s opportunities. You must make things happen, and often under\nconditions or schedules that are not of your own choosing.\nInnovative leadership requires managers to be able to diagnose problems, make effective decisions, influence, and motivate others, manage their personal contacts, bring out the best in their colleagues, optimize cross-functional teams, and drive organisational\nchange.\nThis course prepares you to achieve these objectives. It provides fundamental tools from the behavioural and social sciences that will improve your ability to analyse organisational dynamics, innovate, and lead effectively, while at the same time maintaining\nyour own ethical compass.\nCourse Description\nChina Today: Policy Environment and Future Trends\nThis module covers the current situation and future development trend of China's macro-economy, develops insights into the functions and decision-making mechanism of government institutions\nin China's public management system, analyses the development trend of China's economy and the impact of China's economic policies on business expansion; and helps participants to define future development strategies in the Chinese market.\nDigital Transformation: The Chinese Perspective\nThis module explores international enterprise global deployment of the origin and development of the digital transformation, upgrades the digitized thinking and develops future-oriented\nthinking suitable for the digital transformation of corporate strategy under the new technology and business environment; explores the Social Media and Mobile Internet Era of China's e-commerce market; helps participants to construct innovation ability,\nand gain lasting competitive advantage.\nEco System of China’s Open Innovation\nChina's biggest strength for development lies in its rich human resources. The 1.3 billion Chinese people, of which over 900 million are in the labour force and over 170 million have received\nhigher education or acquired specialized skills, represent an infinite source of entrepreneurship and innovation. China’s continued growth over the last 40 years depends on the country’s capacity on Imitation to Innovation. China has experienced\na substantial transformation in the innovation landscape since the economic reforms and opening up in 1978.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) - Past, Present and Future\nArtificial Intelligence is changing the world in many ways. Technological innovation is the most fundamental driving force for economic growth. Scientific and technological innovation\nhas developed rapidly in modern society. It is very important to understand the frontier of science and technology for seizing the business opportunities.\nCourse Description\nHow do Enterprises Seek Sustainable Development in the Digital Era?\nEnvironmental sustainability is no longer just a corporate social responsibility (CSR) issue. Nor is it important only for compliance and reporting purposes. Opportunities\nand risks related to the environment now challenge the strategies and operating models of organizations across all sectors and functions. Digital technologies will play a key role in enabling pricing mechanisms to function effectively, transparently,\nand in an integrated way. Digital transformation will help make the difference.\nHow to Succeed in China Market Lessons from Multi-National Enterprises?\nChina presents many opportunities for Multinationals (MNCs); and MNCs play a key role in the development of China’s economy. However, conducting successful\nbusiness in China is increasingly challenging. Competition, from both international and domestic players, remains fierce; the rise of e-commerce and the sophisticated Chinese consumer are challenging established business models; attracting, developing\nand retaining talent is more critical than ever. Added to these is tougher enforcement and a higher emphasis on compliance in an already complex regulatory environment. Through interaction with MNC executive, this course is designed for participants\nto develop acumen and insight in the way to succeed in China market.\nRed Swan: Doing Business in China Deciphered\nChina’s rapid economic take-off has been one of the most significant economic event in the world in the past four decades. Most studies have focused on pointing out what China has\ndone right in terms of economic policy and institutional reform—rather than on investigating the fundamental causes of China adopting good economic policies and implementing institutional reforms. The quest for these causes is the major undertaking\nof this course.\nTo understand more about the Nanyang EMBA curriculum, arrange a\n1 to 1 consultation\nwith the team.\nA capstone to the Nanyang EMBA, SPAN is an educational collaboration between external organisations and NBS on select strategy projects.

        "Balancing Work, Family, and Studies": "Completing an Executive MBA while managing work and family is ambitious, but possible with planning and support. Dates are provided well in advance to help participants coordinate work and family schedules. Many engage employers early to align expectations and secure time away. Family support is equally important, and we encourage open conversations to prepare for the journey ahead. While sacrifices are inevitable, clear planning and shared commitment make the difference. And you won’t be doing it alone – you will be supported by faculty, peers, and a programme team who understand the realities of balancing leadership, life, and learning."
